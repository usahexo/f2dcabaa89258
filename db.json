about the qualities of a successful law office, factors such as good communication, efficiency, trust, and client satisfaction are likely to come to mind. But what are the specific traits that make an individual law office thrive?\n\nBelow we will outline five important qualities that any successful law office should have.\n\n1) A Welcoming Atmosphere\n\nOne of the most important qualities for a successful law office is a welcoming atmosphere. This includes having a comfortable waiting area as well as friendly and helpful staff. Clients should feel at ease when visiting your office and be confident that they are in good hands.\n\n2) Effective Communication\n\nEffective communication is key when it comes to running a successful law office. Lawyers and staff should be able to communicate effectively with each other and with clients.

It is one of the most well-known and reputable online betting companies in Asia. The company was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Philippines.\n\n12bet was originally named Asia Sports Betting Company Limited. In 2012, the company rebranded to 12bet to better represent its global reach. 12bet offers a wide range of sports betting options, including live betting, as well as casino and poker games.\n\n#  What is the climate like in Mississippi? \n\nThe climate in Mississippi is humid subtropical. This means the summers are hot and muggy, while the winters are mild and short. Precipitation is common throughout the year, but it is especially high in the spring and fall.\n\n#  Which players are most likely to win the NBA Championship? \n\nThe NBA playoffs are underway, and there are a number of teams with a chance to win the championship. But which players are most likely to lead their team to victory?\n\nIn the Eastern Conference, the Cleveland Cavaliers are the clear favourites. LeBron James is one of the best players in the league, and he has led the Cavaliers to the finals three years in a row. Kyrie Irving is also a top-tier player, and he should be able to carry the team if James falters.\n\nIn the Western Conference, the Golden State Warriors are overwhelming favourites. Stephen Curry is one of the best shooters in NBA history, and Kevin Durant is one of the most versatile players in the league.

There are a number of talented players who could lead their team to victory.\n\n#  How popular is basketball in Mississippi compared to other sports? \n\nBasketball is a very popular sport in Mississippi compared to other sports. According to the Mississippi High School Activities Association, there are over 160 schools that have boys' basketball programs and over 170 schools with girls' basketball programs. This is a considerably higher number than for any other sport. For example, there are only 103 schools that have football programs and only 66 schools with baseball programs. \n\nThere are several reasons for this disparity. For one, basketball is a relatively easy sport to play. All you need is a ball and a court (or even just a driveway). It does not require expensive equipment or special facilities like football or baseball do. \n\nAnother reason is that basketball is an exciting sport to watch. There is always lots of action, making it fun for spectators. And finally, Mississippi has lots of great high school basketball players. The state has produced several NBA stars, including LeBron James and Kobe Bryant. This helps to attract attention to the sport and encourages people to get involved in it.\n\n#  What do you think is the biggest challenge facing basketball in Mississippi?\n\nWhen it comes to basketball in Mississippi, the biggest challenge is the lack of quality coaching. There are very few programs that have consistently produced successful teams and players at the high school and college levels. This is due in part to a lack of resources, but also a lack of qualified coaches. Too often, coaches are hired because they are friends with someone in administration or they have a strong playing background, rather than because they have experience teaching the game and developing young athletes. As a result, many players never receive the proper instruction or motivation necessary to reach their full potential. Until this issue is addressed, basketball will continue to lag behind other sports in the state.","source":"_posts/What-is-the-origin-of-the-name-12bet-.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is the origin of the name 12bet \ndate: 2022-09-23 02:11:40\ncategories:\n- 12bet\ntags:\n- 12bet\n- Online Casino\n- Bet365\n- Casino Game\n- 21 blackjack\n---\n\n\n#  What is the origin of the name 12bet? \n\n12bet is a brand of gaming company that provides online betting services.

This means the summers are hot and muggy, while the winters are mild and short. Precipitation is common throughout the year, but it is especially high in the spring and fall.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Which-players-are-most-likely-to-win-the-NBA-Championship\"><a href=\"#Which-players-are-most-likely-to-win-the-NBA-Championship\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Which players are most likely to win the NBA Championship?\"></a>Which players are most likely to win the NBA Championship?</h1><p>The NBA playoffs are underway, and there are a number of teams with a chance to win the championship. But which players are most likely to lead their team to victory?</p>\n<p>In the Eastern Conference, the Cleveland Cavaliers are the clear favourites. LeBron James is one of the best players in the league, and he has led the Cavaliers to the finals three years in a row. Kyrie Irving is also a top-tier player, and he should be able to carry the team if James falters.</p>\n<p>In the Western Conference, the Golden State Warriors are overwhelming favourites. Stephen Curry is one of the best shooters in NBA history, and Kevin Durant is one of the most versatile players in the league. The Warriors also have a deep bench, which gives them a major advantage over their opponents.</p>\n<p>Regardless of who wins the championship, it should be an exciting playoffs.

According to the Mississippi High School Activities Association, there are over 160 schools that have boys’ basketball programs and over 170 schools with girls’ basketball programs. This is a considerably higher number than for any other sport. For example, there are only 103 schools that have football programs and only 66 schools with baseball programs. </p>\n<p>There are several reasons for this disparity. For one, basketball is a relatively easy sport to play. All you need is a ball and a court (or even just a driveway). It does not require expensive equipment or special facilities like football or baseball do. </p>\n<p>Another reason is that basketball is an exciting sport to watch. There is always lots of action, making it fun for spectators. And finally, Mississippi has lots of great high school basketball players.

In this article, we will walk you through the steps necessary to create an online blackjack game that features surrendering.\n\n## Creating the Game\n\n1. The first step is to create a new file and name it “surrender.js.” This file will contain all of the code necessary for our game.\n\n2. Next, we need to declare some variables. The first variable will be an array of objects that represent each player’s hand. The second variable will be an array of objects that represent the dealer’s hand. The third variable will be an integer that represents the number of decks in use.\n\nvar players = []; var dealers = []; var Deck = 52; //number of cards in a deck\n\n3. The next step is to create a function that will deal cards to both the players and dealers hands. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a dealerIndex . It will also return an object that contains information about the card dealt. This function should look like this:\n\nfunction deal(playerIndex, dealerIndex) { //dealer's cards for (var i = 0; i < Deck; i++) { if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 11) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: \"clubs\" }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 1) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: \"spades\" }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 2) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: \"hearts\" }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 3) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: \"diamonds\" }); } } //returns an object with info about the card dealt return { rank : dealers[dealerIndex][0], suit : dealers[dealerIndex][1] }; }\n\n4. The next step is to create a function that will determine whether or not a player can surrender their hand. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a dealer Index . It should return true if the player wants to surrender and false if they do not want to surrender. This function should look like this:\n\n\nfunction canSurrender(playerindex, dealerindex) { //check each card for (var i = 0; i < players[playerindex].cards().length; ++i) { //if card is 10 or ace if (players[playerindex].cards()[i] >= 10 && players[playerindex].cards() [i] <= Ace) return true; } //if all cards are low value // conclude player cannot surrender if (!players[playerindex].hasMoreCards()) return false; }\n\n\n\n xtrue  } \n\n5. Next, we need to create a function that will allow players to place bets on the game. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a betAmount . It should update the players balance accordingly and also increase the betAmount by the betAmount amount when called again later in the game. This function should look like this: \n\nfunction placeBet(playerindex, betAmount) { //update player's balance players[playerindex].balance += betAmount; //increment betAmount by amount of betAmount so subsequent calls will increase amount by same value betAmount += betAmount; };\n\n6. Finally, we need to create our main() function which will control the flow of our game. This function should accept two parameters: an Array of Players and an Array of Dealers . It should first initialize all variables then call our other functions as needed. The main() function should look like this: \n\nfunction main(players, dealers) { //initialize variables Deck = 52; players = []; dealers = []; for (var i = 0; i < Deck; ++i) { players push({ rank : \"Ace\", suit : \"spades\"}); } for (var j=0 ;j<Deck ;++j){ decks push({ rank : j % 13 + 1, suit : \"clubs\"}); } for (var k=0 ;k<Deck ;++k){ decks push({ rank : k % 13 + 1, suit : \"diamonds\"}); }; init(); console .log(\"Players:\\t\", players); console .log(\"Dealers:\\t\", dealers); while (!isGameOver()) { processInput(); deal(); updateDisplay(); place\n\n#  “Create a Unique On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Minutes”\n\nA number of months ago I released a blog post on how to produce a Blackjack game with surrender working with the Ethereum blockchain and CryptoKitties. Considering that then, I’ve been asked by many people how to develop the same game but with a unique house edge. So in this post, I’ll demonstrate how you can develop your own on the web crypto casino VIP blackjack game with surrender in minutes making use of my code as a starting point.\n\n# Before We Start\n\nIf you want to follow along and create your own game, you will first need to have some basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, you will also require a local development environment set-up which includes Node.js and NPM. If you are not familiar with these technologies, don’t worry - there are plenty of online tutorials which can walk you through the process.\n\n# Creating the Game Board\n\nThe first thing we need to do is create the HTML template for our game board. This will include the layout of our game grid as well as the labels for each column and row. Open up your favorite text editor and create a new file called “game-board.html”. Next, insert the following code into the file:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <title>Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack</title> </head> <body> <div class=\"game-board\"> <h1>Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack</h1> <table class=\"game-board-table\"> <tr><th colspan=\"2\">Game Board</th></tr> <tr><th rowspan=\"2\">Column 1</th><th rowspan=\"2\">Column 2</th><th rowspan=\"2\">Column 3</th><th rowspan=\"2\"></th></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"3\">Number 1</td></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"3\">Number 2</td></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"3\">Number 3</td></tr> </table> </div> </body> </html>\n\nSave this file in your project folder. The code above creates a simple HTML table which will be used to display our game board. We have also included some basic styling which will give our table a neater look. You can see a preview of what this looks like below:\n\nNow that we have our game board in place, let’s start coding up the functionality for our game.\n\n# Coding Up the Game Logic\n\nWe will be using JavaScript to code up the game logic for our blackjack game. Open up a new file called “game.js” and insert the following code into it:\n\nvar GAME_OPTIONS = { // Set the maximum number of players allowed in the game numPlayers: 5, // Set up arrays to store player data playerData: [], dealerData: [], // Create an array to store player's current hand data currentHandData: [], }; function getCoin() { return Math.floor(Math.random()*1000000000).toString(10); } function dealCard(playerId) { // Deal card to player id var dealerIndex = Math.floor((playerId - 1) / 2); var dealerCard = cards[dealerIndex]; return dealerCard; } function hit() { // Called when user wants to hit currentHandData[playerId][0]++; if (currentHandData[playerId][0] > 21) { // Player has gone bust currentHandData[playerId] = []; } } function stand() { // Called when user wants to stand currentHandData[playerId] = []; } functiondoubleDown() { /* Make sure player is allowed to double down */ if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 0) { alert(\"You cannot double down.\"); return; } /* Update hand data */ currentHandData[playerId][1] *= 2; /* Draw another card */ dealCard(playerId); } function split() { /* Make sure player is allowed to split */ if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 11 || currentHandData[playerId][1] === 12) { alert(\"You cannot split.\"); return; } /* Update hand data */ currentHandData[playerId][1] = 0; /* Draw another card */ dealCard(playerId); } function Surrender() { if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 15) { alert(\"You cannot Surrender.\"); return; } currentHandData[playerID][1]=0; } window.onload = init;\n\n#  “How to Setup an On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Less Than Five Minutes”\n\n## Introduction\n\nOnline blackjack has become one of the most popular casino games in the world. Thanks to its simple rules, online blackjack is a great game for beginners and experienced players alike. In this article we will show you how to setup an online blackjack game with surrender in less than five minutes.\n\n## Setting Up the Game\n\nThe first step is to create a new table. To do this, click on the “Tables” tab and then select “Create Table”.\n\nEnter a name for your table and set the minimum and maximum bet sizes. For this example we will set the minimum bet size to $1 and the maximum bet size to $100. Click on “Create Table” to create the table.\n\nNext, we need to add some players to the table. To do this, click on the “Players” tab and then select “Add Player”.\n\nEnter a name for your player and then click on “Add Player”. Repeat this process until you have added all of the players you want to your table.\n\n\n\n ## Playing the Game\nNow that our game is set up, it’s time to play! The basic rules of online blackjack are as follows: - The player is dealt two cards face up - The player can either stand (do nothing) or hit (take another card) - The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over - If the player goes over 21, they lose - If the player stands, their total is compared against that of the dealer - If the player beats the dealer, they win - If the player loses, they lose their bet amount \n\nTo play blackjack, click on one of your players and then click on either “Hit” or “Stand”. When you are done playing your turn, press “Pass” so that it will be the next player’s turn.\n\n#  “Creating an On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game – What You Need to Know”\n\nOnline gambling establishment games are all the rage today. The experience of playing casino games from the convenience of your own home is a big draw for many people. And with the advancement of technology, online casino games have only become more realistic and engaging.\n\nOne great example of an online casino game is blackjack. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and it’s easy to see why. The game is simple to learn but can be quite challenging, which keeps players engaged. And thanks to online casinos, you can now play blackjack against other real players from around the world.\n\nIf you’re interested in playing blackjack online, there are a few things you need to know first. In this article, we’ll discuss how to create an online blackjack game that features surrendering as an option. We’ll also cover what you need to do to get your game up and running. So let’s get started!\n\n# Setting Up the Game\n\nTo create a blackjack game that features surrendering, you first need to set up the game properly. This includes creating the necessary files and folders, as well as setting up the correct file permissions. Here are the steps you need to take:\n\n1) Create a new folder on your web server and name it “blackjack-surrender”. This is where your game files will reside.\n2) Inside the “blackjack-surrender” folder, create another folder named “images”. This is where your game images will reside.\n3) Inside the “blackjack-surrender” folder, create a file named “config.php” and save it in plain text format. This file will contain your game configuration settings. \n4) Copy all of the files from the supplied “src” folder into your “blackjack-surrender” folder. \n5) Set proper file permissions for all files in your “blackjack-surrender” folder using CHMOD notation .755 or 755 for read/write/execute for owner, group, and world; 664 or 664 for read/write for owner and group; 444 or 444 for read only for owner and group).  \nThe following is an example line of CHMOD notation: chmod 755 images/card_back_left_spades_onlonely1 .jpg\nThis will give everyone Read/Write access to the image file located at images/card_back_left_spades_onlonely1 .jpg \n6) If you are using a MySQL database to store player data, create a new database table named “blackjack_surrender” and add the following columns: id – INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT; player_name – VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL; bet – DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT ‘0′ NULL; chips – DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT ‘0′ NULL;created – TIMESTAMP NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;  \n7) If you are not using a MySQL database to store player data, skip this step. \n8 ) Edit the file config.php with your own settings. Be sure to include all required settings (see below). \n9) Upload all of your files to your web server using FTP software (e.g., FileZilla). \n10 ) Test your game by opening it in a web browser on your local computer (localhost). Make sure everything works as expected before going live on a public server! \n\nNow that we have our game set up properly, let's take a look at some of the important configurable options that are available to us in config.php .\n\n# Game Configuration Options\n\nThe following is a list of all configurable options that are available in config.php :\n\ndbhost – The hostname or IP address of your MySQL database server dbuser – The username that has access to your MySQL database dbpass – The password for the dbuser above dbname – The name of your MySQL database tableprefix – A prefix that will be appended to all table names in your MySQL database (optional) enabledSurrendering – Whether or not surrendering is enabled (true = enabled, false = disabled) allowedSurrenderPercentage - The allowed surrender percentage (must be between 0% and 100%) hitOrStandAfterSplitting - Whether or not players are allowed to hit after splitting (true = allowed, false = not allowed) splitLimit - The maximum number of splits that can be made (defaults to 2) doubleDownLimit - The maximum number of doubles that can be made (defaults to 1","source":"_posts/“How-to-Create-an-On-the-web-Crypto-Casino-VIP-Blackjack-with-Surrender-Game-in-Less-Than-Five-Minutes”.md","raw":"---\ntitle: “How to Create an On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Less Than Five Minutes”\ndate: 2022-10-06 19:55:12\ncategories:\n- Gta 5 Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  “How to Create an On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Less Than Five Minutes”\n\n## Introduction\n\nThough online blackjack is one of the most popular games on the internet, many people do not know how to create a game that allows players to surrender.

The next step is to create a function that will determine whether or not a player can surrender their hand. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a dealer Index . It should return true if the player wants to surrender and false if they do not want to surrender. This function should look like this:\n\n\nfunction canSurrender(playerindex, dealerindex) { //check each card for (var i = 0; i < players[playerindex].cards().length; ++i) { //if card is 10 or ace if (players[playerindex].cards()[i] >= 10 && players[playerindex].cards() [i] <= Ace) return true; } //if all cards are low value // conclude player cannot surrender if (!players[playerindex].hasMoreCards()) return false; }\n\n\n\n xtrue  } \n\n5. Next, we need to create a function that will allow players to place bets on the game. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a betAmount . It should update the players balance accordingly and also increase the betAmount by the betAmount amount when called again later in the game. This function should look like this: \n\nfunction placeBet(playerindex, betAmount) { //update player's balance players[playerindex].balance += betAmount; //increment betAmount by amount of betAmount so subsequent calls will increase amount by same value betAmount += betAmount; };\n\n6. Finally, we need to create our main() function which will control the flow of our game. This function should accept two parameters: an Array of Players and an Array of Dealers . It should first initialize all variables then call our other functions as needed. The main() function should look like this: \n\nfunction main(players, dealers) { //initialize variables Deck = 52; players = []; dealers = []; for (var i = 0; i < Deck; ++i) { players push({ rank : \"Ace\", suit : \"spades\"}); } for (var j=0 ;j<Deck ;++j){ decks push({ rank : j % 13 + 1, suit : \"clubs\"}); } for (var k=0 ;k<Deck ;++k){ decks push({ rank : k % 13 + 1, suit : \"diamonds\"}); }; init(); console .log(\"Players:\\t\", players); console .log(\"Dealers:\\t\", dealers); while (!isGameOver()) { processInput(); deal(); updateDisplay(); place\n\n#  “Create a Unique On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Minutes”\n\nA number of months ago I released a blog post on how to produce a Blackjack game with surrender working with the Ethereum blockchain and CryptoKitties. Considering that then, I’ve been asked by many people how to develop the same game but with a unique house edge. So in this post, I’ll demonstrate how you can develop your own on the web crypto casino VIP blackjack game with surrender in minutes making use of my code as a starting point.\n\n# Before We Start\n\nIf you want to follow along and create your own game, you will first need to have some basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, you will also require a local development environment set-up which includes Node.js and NPM. If you are not familiar with these technologies, don’t worry - there are plenty of online tutorials which can walk you through the process.\n\n# Creating the Game Board\n\nThe first thing we need to do is create the HTML template for our game board. This will include the layout of our game grid as well as the labels for each column and row. Open up your favorite text editor and create a new file called “game-board.html”. Next, insert the following code into the file:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <title>Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack</title> </head> <body> <div class=\"game-board\"> <h1>Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack</h1> <table class=\"game-board-table\"> <tr><th colspan=\"2\">Game Board</th></tr> <tr><th rowspan=\"2\">Column 1</th><th rowspan=\"2\">Column 2</th><th rowspan=\"2\">Column 3</th><th rowspan=\"2\"></th></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"3\">Number 1</td></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"3\">Number 2</td></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"3\">Number 3</td></tr> </table> </div> </body> </html>\n\nSave this file in your project folder. The code above creates a simple HTML table which will be used to display our game board. We have also included some basic styling which will give our table a neater look. You can see a preview of what this looks like below:\n\nNow that we have our game board in place, let’s start coding up the functionality for our game.\n\n# Coding Up the Game Logic\n\nWe will be using JavaScript to code up the game logic for our blackjack game. Open up a new file called “game.js” and insert the following code into it:\n\nvar GAME_OPTIONS = { // Set the maximum number of players allowed in the game numPlayers: 5, // Set up arrays to store player data playerData: [], dealerData: [], // Create an array to store player's current hand data currentHandData: [], }; function getCoin() { return Math.floor(Math.random()*1000000000).toString(10); } function dealCard(playerId) { // Deal card to player id var dealerIndex = Math.floor((playerId - 1) / 2); var dealerCard = cards[dealerIndex]; return dealerCard; } function hit() { // Called when user wants to hit currentHandData[playerId][0]++; if (currentHandData[playerId][0] > 21) { // Player has gone bust currentHandData[playerId] = []; } } function stand() { // Called when user wants to stand currentHandData[playerId] = []; } functiondoubleDown() { /* Make sure player is allowed to double down */ if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 0) { alert(\"You cannot double down.\"); return; } /* Update hand data */ currentHandData[playerId][1] *= 2; /* Draw another card */ dealCard(playerId); } function split() { /* Make sure player is allowed to split */ if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 11 || currentHandData[playerId][1] === 12) { alert(\"You cannot split.\"); return; } /* Update hand data */ currentHandData[playerId][1] = 0; /* Draw another card */ dealCard(playerId); } function Surrender() { if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 15) { alert(\"You cannot Surrender.\"); return; } currentHandData[playerID][1]=0; } window.onload = init;\n\n#  “How to Setup an On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Less Than Five Minutes”\n\n## Introduction\n\nOnline blackjack has become one of the most popular casino games in the world. Thanks to its simple rules, online blackjack is a great game for beginners and experienced players alike. In this article we will show you how to setup an online blackjack game with surrender in less than five minutes.\n\n## Setting Up the Game\n\nThe first step is to create a new table. To do this, click on the “Tables” tab and then select “Create Table”.\n\nEnter a name for your table and set the minimum and maximum bet sizes. For this example we will set the minimum bet size to $1 and the maximum bet size to $100. Click on “Create Table” to create the table.\n\nNext, we need to add some players to the table. To do this, click on the “Players” tab and then select “Add Player”.\n\nEnter a name for your player and then click on “Add Player”. Repeat this process until you have added all of the players you want to your table.\n\n\n\n ## Playing the Game\nNow that our game is set up, it’s time to play! The basic rules of online blackjack are as follows: - The player is dealt two cards face up - The player can either stand (do nothing) or hit (take another card) - The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over - If the player goes over 21, they lose - If the player stands, their total is compared against that of the dealer - If the player beats the dealer, they win - If the player loses, they lose their bet amount \n\nTo play blackjack, click on one of your players and then click on either “Hit” or “Stand”. When you are done playing your turn, press “Pass” so that it will be the next player’s turn.\n\n#  “Creating an On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game – What You Need to Know”\n\nOnline gambling establishment games are all the rage today. The experience of playing casino games from the convenience of your own home is a big draw for many people. And with the advancement of technology, online casino games have only become more realistic and engaging.\n\nOne great example of an online casino game is blackjack. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and it’s easy to see why. The game is simple to learn but can be quite challenging, which keeps players engaged. And thanks to online casinos, you can now play blackjack against other real players from around the world.\n\nIf you’re interested in playing blackjack online, there are a few things you need to know first. In this article, we’ll discuss how to create an online blackjack game that features surrendering as an option. We’ll also cover what you need to do to get your game up and running. So let’s get started!\n\n# Setting Up the Game\n\nTo create a blackjack game that features surrendering, you first need to set up the game properly. This includes creating the necessary files and folders, as well as setting up the correct file permissions. Here are the steps you need to take:\n\n1) Create a new folder on your web server and name it “blackjack-surrender”. This is where your game files will reside.\n2) Inside the “blackjack-surrender” folder, create another folder named “images”. This is where your game images will reside.\n3) Inside the “blackjack-surrender” folder, create a file named “config.php” and save it in plain text format. This file will contain your game configuration settings. \n4) Copy all of the files from the supplied “src” folder into your “blackjack-surrender” folder. \n5) Set proper file permissions for all files in your “blackjack-surrender” folder using CHMOD notation .755 or 755 for read/write/execute for owner, group, and world; 664 or 664 for read/write for owner and group; 444 or 444 for read only for owner and group).  \nThe following is an example line of CHMOD notation: chmod 755 images/card_back_left_spades_onlonely1 .jpg\nThis will give everyone Read/Write access to the image file located at images/card_back_left_spades_onlonely1 .jpg \n6) If you are using a MySQL database to store player data, create a new database table named “blackjack_surrender” and add the following columns: id – INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT; player_name – VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL; bet – DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT ‘0′ NULL; chips – DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT ‘0′ NULL;created – TIMESTAMP NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;  \n7) If you are not using a MySQL database to store player data, skip this step. \n8 ) Edit the file config.php with your own settings. Be sure to include all required settings (see below). \n9) Upload all of your files to your web server using FTP software (e.g., FileZilla). \n10 ) Test your game by opening it in a web browser on your local computer (localhost). Make sure everything works as expected before going live on a public server! \n\nNow that we have our game set up properly, let's take a look at some of the important configurable options that are available to us in config.php .\n\n# Game Configuration Options\n\nThe following is a list of all configurable options that are available in config.php :\n\ndbhost – The hostname or IP address of your MySQL database server dbuser – The username that has access to your MySQL database dbpass – The password for the dbuser above dbname – The name of your MySQL database tableprefix – A prefix that will be appended to all table names in your MySQL database (optional) enabledSurrendering – Whether or not surrendering is enabled (true = enabled, false = disabled) allowedSurrenderPercentage - The allowed surrender percentage (must be between 0% and 100%) hitOrStandAfterSplitting - Whether or not players are allowed to hit after splitting (true = allowed, false = not allowed) splitLimit - The maximum number of splits that can be made (defaults to 2) doubleDownLimit - The maximum number of doubles that can be made (defaults to 1","slug":"“How-to-Create-an-On-the-web-Crypto-Casino-VIP-Blackjack-with-Surrender-Game-in-Less-Than-Five-Minutes”","published":1,"updated":"2022-10-06T11:55:12.816Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl8x04uwh000014v55le1cqfd","content":"<h1 id=\"“How-to-Create-an-On-the-web-Crypto-Casino-VIP-Blackjack-with-Surrender-Game-in-Less-Than-Five-Minutes”\"><a href=\"#“How-to-Create-an-On-the-web-Crypto-Casino-VIP-Blackjack-with-Surrender-Game-in-Less-Than-Five-Minutes”\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“How to Create an On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Less Than Five Minutes”\"></a>“How to Create an On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Less Than Five Minutes”</h1><h2 id=\"Introduction\"><a href=\"#Introduction\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Introduction\"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Though online blackjack is one of the most popular games on the internet, many people do not know how to create a game that allows players to surrender.

In this article, we will walk you through the steps necessary to create an online blackjack game that features surrendering.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Creating-the-Game\"><a href=\"#Creating-the-Game\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Creating the Game\"></a>Creating the Game</h2><ol>\n<li><p>The first step is to create a new file and name it “surrender.js.” This file will contain all of the code necessary for our game.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Next, we need to declare some variables. The first variable will be an array of objects that represent each player’s hand. The second variable will be an array of objects that represent the dealer’s hand. The third variable will be an integer that represents the number of decks in use.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>var players = []; var dealers = []; var Deck = 52; //number of cards in a deck</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The next step is to create a function that will deal cards to both the players and dealers hands. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a dealerIndex . It will also return an object that contains information about the card dealt. This function should look like this:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>function deal(playerIndex, dealerIndex) { //dealer’s cards for (var i = 0; i &lt; Deck; i++) { if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 11) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “clubs” }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 1) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “spades” }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 2) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “hearts” }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 3) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “diamonds” }); } } //returns an object with info about the card dealt return { rank : dealers[dealerIndex][0], suit : dealers[dealerIndex][1] }; }</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>The next step is to create a function that will determine whether or not a player can surrender their hand. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a dealer Index . It should return true if the player wants to surrender and false if they do not want to surrender. This function should look like this:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>function canSurrender(playerindex, dealerindex) { //check each card for (var i = 0; i &lt; players[playerindex].cards().length; ++i) { //if card is 10 or ace if (players[playerindex].cards()[i] &gt;= 10 &amp;&amp; players[playerindex].cards() [i] &lt;= Ace) return true; } //if all cards are low value // conclude player cannot surrender if (!players[playerindex].hasMoreCards()) return false; }</p>\n<p> xtrue  } </p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Next, we need to create a function that will allow players to place bets on the game. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a betAmount . It should update the players balance accordingly and also increase the betAmount by the betAmount amount when called again later in the game. This function should look like this: </li>\n</ol>\n<p>function placeBet(playerindex, betAmount) { //update player’s balance players[playerindex].balance += betAmount; //increment betAmount by amount of betAmount so subsequent calls will increase amount by same value betAmount += betAmount; };</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Finally, we need to create our main() function which will control the flow of our game. This function should accept two parameters: an Array of Players and an Array of Dealers . It should first initialize all variables then call our other functions as needed. The main() function should look like this: </li>\n</ol>\n<p>function main(players, dealers) { //initialize variables Deck = 52; players = []; dealers = []; for (var i = 0; i &lt; Deck; ++i) { players push({ rank : “Ace”, suit : “spades”}); } for (var j=0 ;j&lt;Deck ;++j){ decks push({ rank : j % 13 + 1, suit : “clubs”}); } for (var k=0 ;k&lt;Deck ;++k){ decks push({ rank : k % 13 + 1, suit : “diamonds”}); }; init(); console .log(“Players:\\t”, players); console .log(“Dealers:\\t”, dealers); while (!isGameOver()) { processInput(); deal(); updateDisplay(); place</p>\n<h1 id=\"“Create-a-Unique-On-the-web-Crypto-Casino-VIP-Blackjack-with-Surrender-Game-in-Minutes”\"><a href=\"#“Create-a-Unique-On-the-web-Crypto-Casino-VIP-Blackjack-with-Surrender-Game-in-Minutes”\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“Create a Unique On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Minutes”\"></a>“Create a Unique On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Minutes”</h1><p>A number of months ago I released a blog post on how to produce a Blackjack game with surrender working with the Ethereum blockchain and CryptoKitties. Considering that then, I’ve been asked by many people how to develop the same game but with a unique house edge. So in this post, I’ll demonstrate how you can develop your own on the web crypto casino VIP blackjack game with surrender in minutes making use of my code as a starting point.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Before-We-Start\"><a href=\"#Before-We-Start\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Before We Start\"></a>Before We Start</h1><p>If you want to follow along and create your own game, you will first need to have some basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, you will also require a local development environment set-up which includes Node.js and NPM. If you are not familiar with these technologies, don’t worry - there are plenty of online tutorials which can walk you through the process.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Creating-the-Game-Board\"><a href=\"#Creating-the-Game-Board\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Creating the Game Board\"></a>Creating the Game Board</h1><p>The first thing we need to do is create the HTML template for our game board. This will include the layout of our game grid as well as the labels for each column and row. Open up your favorite text editor and create a new file called “game-board.html”. Next, insert the following code into the file:</p>\n<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> <title>Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack</title> </head> <body> <div class=\"game-board\"> <h1>Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack</h1> <table class=\"game-board-table\"> <tr><th colspan=\"2\">Game Board</th></tr> <tr><th rowspan=\"2\">Column 1</th><th rowspan=\"2\">Column 2</th><th rowspan=\"2\">Column 3</th><th rowspan=\"2\"></th></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"3\">Number 1</td></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"3\">Number 2</td></tr> <tr><td colspan=\"3\">Number 3</td></tr> </table> </div> </body> </html>\n\n<p>Save this file in your project folder. The code above creates a simple HTML table which will be used to display our game board. We have also included some basic styling which will give our table a neater look. You can see a preview of what this looks like below:</p>\n<p>Now that we have our game board in place, let’s start coding up the functionality for our game.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Coding-Up-the-Game-Logic\"><a href=\"#Coding-Up-the-Game-Logic\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Coding Up the Game Logic\"></a>Coding Up the Game Logic</h1><p>We will be using JavaScript to code up the game logic for our blackjack game. Open up a new file called “game.js” and insert the following code into it:</p>\n<p>var GAME_OPTIONS = { // Set the maximum number of players allowed in the game numPlayers: 5, // Set up arrays to store player data playerData: [], dealerData: [], // Create an array to store player’s current hand data currentHandData: [], }; function getCoin() { return Math.floor(Math.random()<em>1000000000).toString(10); } function dealCard(playerId) { // Deal card to player id var dealerIndex = Math.floor((playerId - 1) / 2); var dealerCard = cards[dealerIndex]; return dealerCard; } function hit() { // Called when user wants to hit currentHandData[playerId][0]++; if (currentHandData[playerId][0] &gt; 21) { // Player has gone bust currentHandData[playerId] = []; } } function stand() { // Called when user wants to stand currentHandData[playerId] = []; } functiondoubleDown() { /</em> Make sure player is allowed to double down <em>/ if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 0) { alert(“You cannot double down.”); return; } /</em> Update hand data */ currentHandData[playerId][1] <em>= 2; /</em> Draw another card <em>/ dealCard(playerId); } function split() { /</em> Make sure player is allowed to split <em>/ if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 11 || currentHandData[playerId][1] === 12) { alert(“You cannot split.”); return; } /</em> Update hand data <em>/ currentHandData[playerId][1] = 0; /</em> Draw another card */ dealCard(playerId); } function Surrender() { if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 15) { alert(“You cannot Surrender.”); return; } currentHandData[playerID][1]=0; } window.onload = init;</p>\n<h1 id=\"“How-to-Setup-an-On-the-web-Crypto-Casino-VIP-Blackjack-with-Surrender-Game-in-Less-Than-Five-Minutes”\"><a href=\"#“How-to-Setup-an-On-the-web-Crypto-Casino-VIP-Blackjack-with-Surrender-Game-in-Less-Than-Five-Minutes”\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“How to Setup an On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Less Than Five Minutes”\"></a>“How to Setup an On the web Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack with Surrender Game in Less Than Five Minutes”</h1><h2 id=\"Introduction-1\"><a href=\"#Introduction-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Introduction\"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Online blackjack has become one of the most popular casino games in the world.

This is where your game files will reside.</li>\n<li>Inside the “blackjack-surrender” folder, create another folder named “images”. This is where your game images will reside.</li>\n<li>Inside the “blackjack-surrender” folder, create a file named “config.php” and save it in plain text format. This file will contain your game configuration settings. </li>\n<li>Copy all of the files from the supplied “src” folder into your “blackjack-surrender” folder. </li>\n<li>Set proper file permissions for all files in your “blackjack-surrender” folder using CHMOD notation .755 or 755 for read/write/execute for owner, group, and world; 664 or 664 for read/write for owner and group; 444 or 444 for read only for owner and group).<br>The following is an example line of CHMOD notation: chmod 755 images/card_back_left_spades_onlonely1 .jpg<br>This will give everyone Read/Write access to the image file located at images/card_back_left_spades_onlonely1 .jpg </li>\n<li>If you are using a MySQL database to store player data, create a new database table named “blackjack_surrender” and add the following columns: id – INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT; player_name – VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL; bet – DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT ‘0′ NULL; chips – DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT ‘0′ NULL;created – TIMESTAMP NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;  </li>\n<li>If you are not using a MySQL database to store player data, skip this step.<br>8 ) Edit the file config.php with your own settings.

The reason for the demolition was due to suspicions of corruption involving the casino's ownership.\n\nThe casino was initially put up for sale in early 2017, but no buyers were found. It is now being alleged that potential buyers pulled out after it became known that the casino was under investigation by the NBA. league officials have not commented on any possible connections between the sale and the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe Trump Casino has been in operation since 1990 and was one of the first casinos to be built outside of Atlantic City. It is estimated that over the years, the casino has generated over $1 billion in revenue.\n\nDonald Trump, who was a part owner of the casino until 2004, has denied any involvement in or knowledge of any illegal activity.\n\n#  Trump Casino Shut Down After Illegal Activities Uncovered\n\nThe Trump Taj Mahal casino, once a popular destination for tourists and Atlantic City residents, was shut down after investigators discovered widespread illegal activities taking place at the casino.\n\nAccording to reports, the casino was engaged in money laundering, fraud, and other illegal activities. In addition, the casino had failed to pay out millions of dollars in winnings to customers.\n\nAfter years of financial troubles, the Trump Taj Mahal finally closed its doors in October 2016. This closure marks another chapter in the saga of Donald Trump's failed business ventures.\n\n#  Trump Casino Destroyed by NBA to Protect Integrity of the Game\nThe NBA's decision to destroy the Trump casino was a calculated move to protect the integrity of the game.\n\nDonald Trump has a history of associating with gambling and casinos, which is why the NBA was concerned about his involvement in the Trump casino. The NBA doesn't want any hint of impropriety associated with its games, and they certainly didn't want their brand tarnished by Trump's questionable business practices.\n\nThe Trump casino was a complete disaster and it's no surprise that it went bankrupt. Not only did Trump have a history of shady business deals, but he also had a terrible track record when it came to managing casinos. The casino was plagued by financial troubles and construction delays, and it ultimately failed to attract enough guests to turn a profit.\n\nThe NBA's decision to destroy the casino was likely motivated by more than just concerns about the integrity of the game. It's also possible that the NBA didn't want to be affiliated with Trump given his controversial statements about immigrants and other minority groups.\n\n#  Demolition of Trump Casino Nets $500 Million in Taxpayer Savings\n\nThe demolition of the Trump Casino in Atlantic City, NJ has yielded a positive result for taxpayers with the net taxpayers savings estimated at $500 million. The work began in May of 2018 and was completed this month, September 2018.\n\nAtlantic City Mayor Don Guardian said in a statement:\n\"The Trump Taj Mahal was an eyesore and its demolition is a big win for Atlantic City. I am grateful to our state and federal partners who helped make this happen. Not only have we created hundreds of jobs and generated economic activity, but we've also saved taxpayers millions of dollars.\"\n\nIn addition to the savings for taxpayers, the demolition has created over 1,000 jobs and has resulted in $27 million in economic activity.\n\n#  Trump Casino's Demise Highlights Need for Reform in Sports Gambling\n\nThe closure of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino this past October marked the end of an era in the world of U.S. gambling. The casino, which opened its doors in 1990, was one of the first in the country to offer legalized sports betting. At a time when Atlantic City was the only game in town for legal gambling, Trump's casino helped to usher in a new age of gaming and entertainment.\n\nHowever, as with many things associated with Donald Trump, the good times didn't last forever. In recent years, the Taj Mahal had been struggling to keep up with its competition, largely due to its outdated facilities and diminishing customer base. With little hope of turning things around, Trump's company decided to shut down the casino for good.\n\nWhile the closure of the Taj Mahal is certainly a setback for Atlantic City, it may also be a sign of things to come in the world of sports gambling. In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards legalization and regulation of sports betting, with several states currently considering legislation on the issue.\n\nThis trend is being driven by two major factors: changing public opinion and increasing demand from consumers. A poll released earlier this year by ESPN showed that 60% of all Americans now support legalizing sports betting nationwide. This is a significant shift from just a few years ago, when most people opposed it.\n\nThe other factor at play is increasing demand from consumers. Gambling on sporting events has always been popular, but it has exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to online platforms like DraftKings and FanDuel. These platforms have made it easier than ever for people to place bets on their favorite teams, and they have generated millions of dollars in revenue for their operators.\n\nAs more and more states legalize sports betting, it will become increasingly difficult for casinos like Trump's Taj Mahal to survive. The days when casinos could simply offer sports betting as an afterthought are coming to an end, and operators will need to offer more innovative products and services if they want to stay competitive.\n\nThis is not only good news for consumers but also for regulators who have long been calling for increased oversight of the gambling industry. With sports betting becoming increasingly mainstream, there is a greater need for regulation and consumer protection measures to ensure that people are treated fairly and that no one is taken advantage of.\n\nIn short, while the closure of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino is certainly disappointing, it may also be a sign of things to come in the world of sports gambling. As public opinion shifts and demand continues to grow, we can expect to see more legalized gambling across the country – including more casinos offering sports betting as a central component of their business model","source":"_posts/Trump-Casino-Demolished-by-NBA-League-Officials-Due-to-Possible-Corruption.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Trump Casino Demolished by NBA League Officials Due to Possible Corruption\ndate: 2022-10-17 19:30:56\ncategories:\n- Trump Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  Trump Casino Demolished by NBA League Officials Due to Possible Corruption\n\nThe long-standing Trump Casino, one of the largest in the United States, has been demolished by NBA league officials.

The reason for the demolition was due to suspicions of corruption involving the casino’s ownership.</p>\n<p>The casino was initially put up for sale in early 2017, but no buyers were found. It is now being alleged that potential buyers pulled out after it became known that the casino was under investigation by the NBA. league officials have not commented on any possible connections between the sale and the ongoing investigation.</p>\n<p>The Trump Casino has been in operation since 1990 and was one of the first casinos to be built outside of Atlantic City. It is estimated that over the years, the casino has generated over $1 billion in revenue.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump, who was a part owner of the casino until 2004, has denied any involvement in or knowledge of any illegal activity.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Trump-Casino-Shut-Down-After-Illegal-Activities-Uncovered\"><a href=\"#Trump-Casino-Shut-Down-After-Illegal-Activities-Uncovered\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Trump Casino Shut Down After Illegal Activities Uncovered\"></a>Trump Casino Shut Down After Illegal Activities Uncovered</h1><p>The Trump Taj Mahal casino, once a popular destination for tourists and Atlantic City residents, was shut down after investigators discovered widespread illegal activities taking place at the casino.</p>\n<p>According to reports, the casino was engaged in money laundering, fraud, and other illegal activities. In addition, the casino had failed to pay out millions of dollars in winnings to customers.</p>\n<p>After years of financial troubles, the Trump Taj Mahal finally closed its doors in October 2016. This closure marks another chapter in the saga of Donald Trump’s failed business ventures.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Trump-Casino-Destroyed-by-NBA-to-Protect-Integrity-of-the-Game\"><a href=\"#Trump-Casino-Destroyed-by-NBA-to-Protect-Integrity-of-the-Game\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Trump Casino Destroyed by NBA to Protect Integrity of the Game\"></a>Trump Casino Destroyed by NBA to Protect Integrity of the Game</h1><p>The NBA’s decision to destroy the Trump casino was a calculated move to protect the integrity of the game.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump has a history of associating with gambling and casinos, which is why the NBA was concerned about his involvement in the Trump casino. The NBA doesn’t want any hint of impropriety associated with its games, and they certainly didn’t want their brand tarnished by Trump’s questionable business practices.</p>\n<p>The Trump casino was a complete disaster and it’s no surprise that it went bankrupt. Not only did Trump have a history of shady business deals, but he also had a terrible track record when it came to managing casinos. The casino was plagued by financial troubles and construction delays, and it ultimately failed to attract enough guests to turn a profit.</p>\n<p>The NBA’s decision to destroy the casino was likely motivated by more than just concerns about the integrity of the game. It’s also possible that the NBA didn’t want to be affiliated with Trump given his controversial statements about immigrants and other minority groups.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Demolition-of-Trump-Casino-Nets-500-Million-in-Taxpayer-Savings\"><a href=\"#Demolition-of-Trump-Casino-Nets-500-Million-in-Taxpayer-Savings\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Demolition of Trump Casino Nets $500 Million in Taxpayer Savings\"></a>Demolition of Trump Casino Nets $500 Million in Taxpayer Savings</h1><p>The demolition of the Trump Casino in Atlantic City, NJ has yielded a positive result for taxpayers with the net taxpayers savings estimated at $500 million. The work began in May of 2018 and was completed this month, September 2018.</p>\n<p>Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian said in a statement:<br>“The Trump Taj Mahal was an eyesore and its demolition is a big win for Atlantic City. I am grateful to our state and federal partners who helped make this happen. Not only have we created hundreds of jobs and generated economic activity, but we’ve also saved taxpayers millions of dollars.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the savings for taxpayers, the demolition has created over 1,000 jobs and has resulted in $27 million in economic activity.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Trump-Casino’s-Demise-Highlights-Need-for-Reform-in-Sports-Gambling\"><a href=\"#Trump-Casino’s-Demise-Highlights-Need-for-Reform-in-Sports-Gambling\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Trump Casino’s Demise Highlights Need for Reform in Sports Gambling\"></a>Trump Casino’s Demise Highlights Need for Reform in Sports Gambling</h1><p>The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino this past October marked the end of an era in the world of U.S. gambling. The casino, which opened its doors in 1990, was one of the first in the country to offer legalized sports betting. At a time when Atlantic City was the only game in town for legal gambling, Trump’s casino helped to usher in a new age of gaming and entertainment.</p>\n<p>However, as with many things associated with Donald Trump, the good times didn’t last forever. In recent years, the Taj Mahal had been struggling to keep up with its competition, largely due to its outdated facilities and diminishing customer base. With little hope of turning things around, Trump’s company decided to shut down the casino for good.</p>\n<p>While the closure of the Taj Mahal is certainly a setback for Atlantic City, it may also be a sign of things to come in the world of sports gambling. In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards legalization and regulation of sports betting, with several states currently considering legislation on the issue.</p>\n<p>This trend is being driven by two major factors: changing public opinion and increasing demand from consumers. A poll released earlier this year by ESPN showed that 60% of all Americans now support legalizing sports betting nationwide. This is a significant shift from just a few years ago, when most people opposed it.</p>\n<p>The other factor at play is increasing demand from consumers. Gambling on sporting events has always been popular, but it has exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to online platforms like DraftKings and FanDuel. These platforms have made it easier than ever for people to place bets on their favorite teams, and they have generated millions of dollars in revenue for their operators.</p>\n<p>As more and more states legalize sports betting, it will become increasingly difficult for casinos like Trump’s Taj Mahal to survive. The days when casinos could simply offer sports betting as an afterthought are coming to an end, and operators will need to offer more innovative products and services if they want to stay competitive.</p>\n<p>This is not only good news for consumers but also for regulators who have long been calling for increased oversight of the gambling industry. With sports betting becoming increasingly mainstream, there is a greater need for regulation and consumer protection measures to ensure that people are treated fairly and that no one is taken advantage of.</p>\n<p>In short, while the closure of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino is certainly disappointing, it may also be a sign of things to come in the world of sports gambling. As public opinion shifts and demand continues to grow, we can expect to see more legalized gambling across the country – including more casinos offering sports betting as a central component of their business model</p>\n"},{"title":"Relax Gaming (ReelPlay) Casino Acquires Ownership of Sky River Casino","date":"2022-10-18T13:43:27.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  Relax Gaming (ReelPlay) Casino Acquires Ownership of Sky River Casino\n\n Relax Gaming (ReelPlay) Casino announced today that it has acquired full ownership of Sky River Casino.\n\n“We are very excited about this acquisition,” said Relax Gaming (ReelPlay) Casino CEO, Johnathon Jones. “Sky River Casino is a top-notch casino and a perfect addition to our family of brands.

There are a few things that can be done to help get the most out of this guitar.\n\nOne of the first things that can be done is to make sure that the strings are properly intonated. This means that the notes will ring true when played, and it can help to give a thicker tone overall. Secondly, it might be helpful to raise the action on the guitar. This can be done by adjusting the screws on the bridge. Doing this will help to prevent any buzzing from occurring when playing, and it can also help to give a thicker tone.\n\nLastly, it might also be helpful to use heavier strings on the guitar. This can help to provide more of a presence in the overall tone, and it can be great for someone who is looking for a thicker sound. Heavier strings might also require some adjustments to the set up of the guitar in order for them to be played correctly, but it can be well worth it in order to achieve the desired tone.\n\n#  Tips for Getting a Thick Tone from Your Epiphone Casino in MN \n\n1. Get a quality guitar: You don't want to skimp on your instrument if you're looking for a thick tone. Make sure you're using a guitar that's been well-maintained and is in good playing condition.\n\n2. Experiment with different amp settings: Every amp will produce a different tone, so it's important to experiment until you find the right sound for you. Try different settings on the gain, EQ, and reverb to see what works best.\n\n3. Use proper technique: It's essential that you use good technique when playing your Casino if you want to achieve that thick tone. Make sure to use your fingers rather than your thumb, and be sure to hit the strings with the right amount of force.\n\n4. Use a picks: If you're not using a pick, you're probably not getting the fullest sound from your Casino. A picks can help create more volume and brightness when playing.\n\n5. Practice regularly: The more you practice, the better you'll play and the thicker your tone will be. Be sure to focus on exercises that improve your technique and expand your range.\n\n#  How to Amp Up Your Epiphone Casino's Tone in MN \n\nI'm not going to lie; there's something about an Epiphone Casino that just oozes cool. Maybe it's the thin body, or the fact that they've been used by some of the greatest guitar players of all time. Heck, it could even be the price tag. Whatever it is, if you're like me, you want your Casino to sound as good as possible.\n\nLuckily, there are a few things you can do to get your Casino sounding great in no time! Here are a few tips:\n\n1) upgrading your pickups can make a world of difference in terms of tone. A set of Seymour Duncan Seth Lover pickups can really help you get those classic tones that the Casino is known for.\n\n2) Another easy way to improve your Casino's tone is to upgrade your pots and capacitors. By doing this, you'll be able to dial in your tone more specifically and get rid of any unwanted noise or humming.\n\n3) If you really want to take your Casino's tone up a notch, consider installing a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece. This will add sustain and depth to your sound, and will make it easier to create those lush bends and vibrato effects.\n\n4) Last but not least, be sure to keep your Casino well-tuned and in good shape. A guitar that isn't properly tuned or maintained won't sound its best, no matter what modifications or upgrades you make to it.\n\n#  Strumming for a Thick Sound: Playing the Epiphone Casino in Minnesota \n\nFor guitarists who are looking for a thick, classic sound, the Epiphone Casino can be a great option. This guitar is known for its warm and full tones, which can be perfect for players in Minnesota who want to stand out from the rest of the pack.\n\nThe Casino has been used by a number of well-known musicians over the years, including John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison. While it's not always easy to find one of these guitars in person, they're definitely worth a try if you're looking for a vintage vibe.\n\nIn order to get the most out of your Casino, you'll need to know how to strum it correctly. One of the things that makes this guitar so special is its ability to produce deep and resonant notes. If you're not careful, though, you might end up with a muddy sound.\n\nHere are a few tips for strumming your Casino correctly: \n\n1) Use a light touch – You don't need to use a lot of force when strumming your Casino. In fact, doing so can actually muffle the sound. Try to use a gentle touch instead, and focus on creating smooth and consistent strokes. \n\n2) Use your wrist – When strumming the Casino, use your wrist to generate power instead of your arm. This will help you stay in control and produce cleaner sounds. \n\n3) Experiment with different techniques – There are a number of different strumming techniques that you can experiment with on the Casino. Try out some of these techniques and see which ones work best for you.\n\n#  How to Create a Fuller Tone with Your Epiphone Casino in the Land of 10,000 Lakes\n\nMinnesota may have a population of just over 10,000 people, but it's a big state with plenty of both natural and man-made beauty to offer. If you're an Epiphone Casino player looking to get the most out of your instrument in this \"Land of 10,000 Lakes,\" read on for some tips.\n\nWhen it comes to getting a fuller tone from your Casino, one key is proper string height.

One of those basics is a balloon centerpiece. Making a casino balloon centerpiece is actually much easier than you might think.\n\nTo make a casino balloon centerpiece, you will need: \n-One large round balloon \n-Two smaller round balloons \n-Black electrical tape \n-A green pipe cleaner \n-A white pipe cleaner \n\n1) Inflate the large round balloon and tie it off with black electrical tape. Cut the excess off so that the balloon is even all around. This will be your base.\n2) Take one of the smaller round balloons and inflate it. Do not tie it off. Instead, cut a small hole in the top and insert the green pipe cleaner. The pipe cleaner should go through the hole and come out the bottom of the balloon. Twist the pipe cleaner around itself to hold it in place. Repeat this process with the other small round balloon, but use the white pipe cleaner this time.\n3) Take the black electrical tape and wrap it around the bottom of both of the small balloons so that they are attached to the large round balloon. Make sure that they are evenly spaced apart.\n4) Your casino balloon centerpiece is now finished!\n\n#  Balloon Slot Machines: How to Create a Gaming Centerpiece \n\nIt’s party time and you want to create a gaming centerpiece that will wow your guests. Why not try balloon slot machines? Not only are they fun and easy to make, but they’re also sure to get everyone in the party spirit.\n\nWhat You’ll Need:\n\n-A few dozen balloons in various colors\n-Tape\n-Scissors\n-Playing cards\n-Pipe cleaners (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1) Blow up your balloons and tie them off with a piece of tape. For a more realistic look, use different shades of the same color balloon. \n2) Cut two playing cards in half so that you have four card-sized pieces. \n3) Tape one playing card to each end of a pipe cleaner, if using. \n4) Push the pipe cleaners through the center of two balloons so that the playing cards are sticking out on either side. \n5) Secure the balloons in place with another piece of tape. \n6) Repeat steps 2-5 for as many balloon slot machines as you like!\n\n#  How to Make a Casino-Themed Balloon Centerpiece \n\nBalloons are an easy and affordable way to add a touch of fun to any party. And if you want to go all-out casino for your next get-together, you can make a balloon centerpiece that’s fit for a king or queen of the casino! \n\nTo make this centerpiece, you’ll need some basic supplies: balloons in different colors (including black and white), scissors, a ruler, tape, and a straw. You might also want some craft glue or hot glue, depending on how well you want the finished product to look. \n\nThe first step is to blow up some black balloons. These will be the base of your centerpiece. Blow them up as large as you can – you don’t want them to be too small once they’re inflated. \n\nNext, cut strips of white paper about an inch wide. Tape one end of each strip around the black balloon, making sure it’s nice and tight. Go all the way around the balloon until it’s covered with white paper. Leave a small tail hanging off the end of each strip. \n\nOnce all your black balloons are covered in white paper, it’s time to start adding features! Cut out small circles from black paper and tape them randomly onto the balloons. You can also use other types of shapes – stars, diamonds, etc. If you have any hot glue, you can give the finished product a more polished look by gluing on some extra decorations. \n\nFinally, cut 2-3 inch pieces from a straw and tape them horizontally across the top of your centerpiece so that people can hold onto it easily when they blow up their own balloons. And there you have it – a festive and fun casino-themed balloon centerpiece!\n\n#  How to Turn Balloons into Slot Machines \n\nStep 1: The first step is to inflate the balloon. You can either do this with a pump or by mouth.\n\nStep 2: Once the balloon is inflated, tie a knot in the top to keep the air from escaping.\n\nStep 3: Take a small steel washer and tie it to the end of a piece of string.\n\nStep 4: Push the washer through the hole in the balloon, so that it is on the inside of the balloon.\n\nStep 5: Blow into the balloon, until it is about twice its original size. The washer will start spinning with the air flow.\n\nStep 6: If you want to make it more challenging, you can add more washers onto the string, making sure that they are all lined up on one side of the balloon. \n\nNow you’re ready to play! Hold onto the string and move your hand around to make the washers spin faster. The object of the game is to keep the washers spinning for as long as possible.\n\n#  Create an Impressive Casino Party with These Balloon Slot Tips\n\nPeople love casino night parties. They are always a fun time, and everyone enjoys themselves. If you want to make your party even more special, consider using some balloon slots. Here are some tips for creating an impressive casino party with balloon slots:\n\n1. Choose the right theme: It is important to choose the right theme for your party.

You might also want some craft glue or hot glue, depending on how well you want the finished product to look. \n\nThe first step is to blow up some black balloons. These will be the base of your centerpiece. Blow them up as large as you can – you don’t want them to be too small once they’re inflated. \n\nNext, cut strips of white paper about an inch wide.

And there you have it – a festive and fun casino-themed balloon centerpiece!\n\n#  How to Turn Balloons into Slot Machines \n\nStep 1: The first step is to inflate the balloon. You can either do this with a pump or by mouth.\n\nStep 2: Once the balloon is inflated, tie a knot in the top to keep the air from escaping.\n\nStep 3: Take a small steel washer and tie it to the end of a piece of string.\n\nStep 4: Push the washer through the hole in the balloon, so that it is on the inside of the balloon.\n\nStep 5: Blow into the balloon, until it is about twice its original size. The washer will start spinning with the air flow.\n\nStep 6: If you want to make it more challenging, you can add more washers onto the string, making sure that they are all lined up on one side of the balloon. \n\nNow you’re ready to play! Hold onto the string and move your hand around to make the washers spin faster. The object of the game is to keep the washers spinning for as long as possible.\n\n#  Create an Impressive Casino Party with These Balloon Slot Tips\n\nPeople love casino night parties.

This decision will be largely based on a number of factors such as licensing requirements and taxation rates. Once a jurisdiction has been chosen, it is necessary to apply for a license from the relevant gaming authority. The application process can be lengthy and often requires detailed due diligence on the part of the applicant.\n\nIn addition to obtaining a gaming license, it is also necessary to set up a payment processing system in order to handle deposits and withdrawals from players.

It is also important to ensure that the payment processor can handle transactions in the relevant currency.\n\nAnother key step in establishing an online casino is setting up a website. This involves not only designing a site that looks professional but also developing software that meets the required gaming standards. It is also important to create an effective marketing strategy in order to draw players to the site.\n\nAssuming all of these steps have been taken, there are still some additional items that need to be considered before launching an online casino. These include compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations as well as ensuring that sufficient funds are available to cover potential liabilities.\n\n#  The essentials of starting and running an online gambling operation \nThe gambling industry is a massive global market, and it’s only getting bigger. So if you’re thinking of starting an online gambling operation, there’s no time like the present. But before you do, there are a few essentials you need to know.\n\n1.

You need to have procedures in place to ensure that your customers are legitimate and that your business is not being used for money laundering or terrorist financing activities.\n\n3. Licensing \nBefore you can start accepting bets from customers, you’ll need a gambling licence from the relevant authority. In most cases, this will be the government body responsible for gambling regulation in your jurisdiction. The licensing process can be complex and time-consuming, so make sure you factor that into your timeline.\n\n4. Marketing \nOnce you have your licence and are ready to go live, it’s time to start marketing your new gambling operation. This can be done through traditional advertising channels such as TV, radio and newspapers, or through more modern methods such as social media and search engine optimization (SEO). Whichever route you choose, make sure you have a clear strategy and budget in place.\n\n5. Customer support \nNo matter how good your casino or betting site is, there will always be customers who have problems with their accounts or who want help with their bets. That’s why it’s essential to have a well-staffed customer support team in place who can handle any queries or problems that players may have.\n\n#  How to make your online gambling venture a success\n\nThere are many things that you need to do in order to make your online gambling venture a success.

In this article we will explore some of the key steps involved in starting an online casino.\n\nOne of the most important decisions for anyone looking to start an online casino is choosing a jurisdiction in which to operate. This decision will be largely based on a number of factors such as licensing requirements and taxation rates. Once a jurisdiction has been chosen, it is necessary to apply for a license from the relevant gaming authority. The application process can be lengthy and often requires detailed due diligence on the part of the applicant.\n\nIn addition to obtaining a gaming license, it is also necessary to set up a payment processing system in order to handle deposits and withdrawals from players.

It is also important to ensure that the payment processor can handle transactions in the relevant currency.\n\nAnother key step in establishing an online casino is setting up a website.

So if you’re thinking of starting an online gambling operation, there’s no time like the present. But before you do, there are a few essentials you need to know.\n\n1.

Each country has its own laws governing gambling, so make sure you understand what’s allowed and what isn’t.\n\n2. compliance \nGambling operations need to be compliant with a number of regulations and standards, including those related to anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). You need to have procedures in place to ensure that your customers are legitimate and that your business is not being used for money laundering or terrorist financing activities.\n\n3. Licensing \nBefore you can start accepting bets from customers, you’ll need a gambling licence from the relevant authority. In most cases, this will be the government body responsible for gambling regulation in your jurisdiction. The licensing process can be complex and time-consuming, so make sure you factor that into your timeline.\n\n4. Marketing \nOnce you have your licence and are ready to go live, it’s time to start marketing your new gambling operation. This can be done through traditional advertising channels such as TV, radio and newspapers, or through more modern methods such as social media and search engine optimization (SEO). Whichever route you choose, make sure you have a clear strategy and budget in place.\n\n5. Customer support \nNo matter how good your casino or betting site is, there will always be customers who have problems with their accounts or who want help with their bets. That’s why it’s essential to have a well-staffed customer support team in place who can handle any queries or problems that players may have.\n\n#  How to make your online gambling venture a success\n\nThere are many things that you need to do in order to make your online gambling venture a success. In this article, we will discuss some of the most important ones.\n\n1. Choose the right gambling site\n\nThe first step is to choose the right gambling site.

You can do your research online or ask for recommendations from friends.\n\n2. Deposit money only into authorized accounts\n\nAnother important thing to remember is to deposit money only into authorized accounts. Never deposit money into an account that you do not trust. This will help reduce the risk of being scammed or having your money stolen.\n\n3. Gamble responsibly\n\nFinally, always gamble responsibly. Never bet more than you can afford to lose and always be mindful of the risks involved in gambling. This will help ensure that you enjoy your experience without any negative consequences.","slug":"10-steps-to-starting-an-online-gambling-business-","published":1,"updated":"2022-11-08T16:47:35.409Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cla8g3yet0000x8v54jn73oel","content":"<h1 id=\"10-steps-to-starting-an-online-gambling-business\"><a href=\"#10-steps-to-starting-an-online-gambling-business\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"10 steps to starting an online gambling business\"></a>10 steps to starting an online gambling business</h1><p>The global online gambling market is forecast to be worth more than $57.83 billion by 2020, so there’s no doubt that starting an online gambling business is a lucrative venture.

He was accompanied by a group of friends and was observed playing blackjack and electronic poker.\n\nRidley is coming off a stellar sophomore season in which he hauled in 89 receptions for 1,045 yards and seven touchdowns. He is expected to be one of the top players in the country this upcoming season and is currently considered the No. 2 wide receiver prospect for the 2019 NFL Draft.\n\nThis is not the first time that Ridley has been involved in off-the-field issues. In May of 2017, he was cited for possession of marijuana paraphernalia.\n\nAlabama coach Nick Saban released a statement on Sunday regarding Ridley's latest incident.\n\n\"We are aware of the situation involving Calvin Ridley and we are still gathering information,\" Saban said. \"We are very disappointed any time one of our players makes an unwise decision.\"\n\nRidley has not yet commented on the matter.\n\n#  Calvin Ridley Gambling: Nick Saban Comments on WR's Actions\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide wide receiver Calvin Ridley has come under fire this offseason for his actions at a casino in Biloxi, Mississippi. Head coach Nick Saban addressed the issue at Alabama's fan day on Saturday.\n\n\"I'm not happy about it,\" Saban said. \"Nobody's happy about it. It's not what we want our players to do.\"\n\nRidley was photographed at the casino table on April 28 and 29. The photos quickly made the rounds on social media and sparked criticism from some Tide fans.\n\nRidley isn't the only Alabama player to make headlines this offseason. Running back Bo Scarbrough and defensive lineman Da'Shawn Hand were both arrested on alcohol-related charges in late May.\n\nSaban said he has spoken to all three players about their off-the-field issues.\n\n\"We've had conversations with all these guys,\" Saban said. \"I'm not going to get into all the details of it, but I am disappointed and we are going to continue to try to help them learn how to make better decisions.\"\n\nRidley, a junior, is considered one of the top receivers in college football. He caught 63 passes for 967 yards and five touchdowns last season.\n\n#  How Did Calvin Ridley Get Caught Gambling?\n\nIn order to get caught gambling, Calvin Ridley had to make a few mistakes. Most importantly, he had to put himself in a situation where he could be caught. And that's exactly what he did.\n\nRidley was gambling at a casino in Atlantic City, which is not far from his hometown of Fort Lauderdale. That's not the only mistake he made though. He was also caught on camera. And as we all know, cameras never lie.\n\nSo how did Ridley get caught gambling? It all started with an anonymous tip to the police. Someone apparently recognized Ridley and tipped off the authorities. They then alerted the casino, and the rest is history.\n\nRidley has since issued an apology, but it may be too little too late. He could face serious penalties from both the NFL and the casino, and his career may be in jeopardy.\n\n#  Alabama WR Calvin Ridley Admits to Gambling, Apologizes\n\nAlabama wide receiver Calvin Ridley has admitted to gambling and apologized for his actions.\n\"I apologize to my coaches, teammates and everyone associated with the University of Alabama,\" Ridley said in a statement. \"I know I let down my family, my coaches and my teammates.

This is not true – Visa gift cards can be used at casinos, and in fact, they may be the best option for some players.\n\nThe first thing to understand about using a Visa gift card at a casino is that not all casinos accept them. It is important to check with the casino before trying to use a gift card as a form of payment. If the casino does accept Visa gift cards, there are a few things you need to know about how they work.\n\nFirst, Visa gift cards are not reloadable. This means that you cannot add money to them once they have been activated. Second, the funds on a Visa gift card can only be used for purchase transactions, not cash withdrawals. This means that you cannot use your Visa gift card to get cash out of a casino’s ATM machine. Finally, Visa gift cards expire after a certain amount of time – usually around six months from the date of activation.\n\nDespite these limitations, Visa gift cards offer some advantages over traditional methods of funding casino accounts like debit or credit cards. For one, they are widely accepted by casinos both in the United States and around the world. They are also convenient because they can be used anywhere that accepts Visa payments. Finally, because they are not linked to any bank or credit account, they are relatively safe and secure when compared to other methods of payment.\n\n#  What Gambling Sites Accept Visa Gift Cards?\n\nVisa gift cards are a popular way to give money as a gift.
