#  The Easiest Way to Make a Casino Balloon Centerpiece 

When it comes to decorating for a casino party, there are some basics that you need to have. One of those basics is a balloon centerpiece. Making a casino balloon centerpiece is actually much easier than you might think.

To make a casino balloon centerpiece, you will need: 
-One large round balloon 
-Two smaller round balloons 
-Black electrical tape 
-A green pipe cleaner 
-A white pipe cleaner 

1) Inflate the large round balloon and tie it off with black electrical tape. Cut the excess off so that the balloon is even all around. This will be your base.
2) Take one of the smaller round balloons and inflate it. Do not tie it off. Instead, cut a small hole in the top and insert the green pipe cleaner. The pipe cleaner should go through the hole and come out the bottom of the balloon. Twist the pipe cleaner around itself to hold it in place. Repeat this process with the other small round balloon, but use the white pipe cleaner this time.
3) Take the black electrical tape and wrap it around the bottom of both of the small balloons so that they are attached to the large round balloon. Make sure that they are evenly spaced apart.
4) Your casino balloon centerpiece is now finished!

#  How to Make a Casino-Themed Balloon Centerpiece 

Balloons are an easy and affordable way to add a touch of fun to any party. And if you want to go all-out casino for your next get-together, you can make a balloon centerpiece that’s fit for a king or queen of the casino! 

To make this centerpiece, you’ll need some basic supplies: balloons in different colors (including black and white), scissors, a ruler, tape, and a straw. You might also want some craft glue or hot glue, depending on how well you want the finished product to look. 

The first step is to blow up some black balloons. These will be the base of your centerpiece. Blow them up as large as you can – you don’t want them to be too small once they’re inflated. 

Next, cut strips of white paper about an inch wide. Tape one end of each strip around the black balloon, making sure it’s nice and tight. Go all the way around the balloon until it’s covered with white paper. Leave a small tail hanging off the end of each strip. 

Once all your black balloons are covered in white paper, it’s time to start adding features! Cut out small circles from black paper and tape them randomly onto the balloons. You can also use other types of shapes – stars, diamonds, etc. If you have any hot glue, you can give the finished product a more polished look by gluing on some extra decorations. 

Finally, cut 2-3 inch pieces from a straw and tape them horizontally across the top of your centerpiece so that people can hold onto it easily when they blow up their own balloons. And there you have it – a festive and fun casino-themed balloon centerpiece!

#  How to Turn Balloons into Slot Machines 

Step 1: The first step is to inflate the balloon. You can either do this with a pump or by mouth.

Step 2: Once the balloon is inflated, tie a knot in the top to keep the air from escaping.

Step 3: Take a small steel washer and tie it to the end of a piece of string.

Step 4: Push the washer through the hole in the balloon, so that it is on the inside of the balloon.

Step 5: Blow into the balloon, until it is about twice its original size. The washer will start spinning with the air flow.

Step 6: If you want to make it more challenging, you can add more washers onto the string, making sure that they are all lined up on one side of the balloon. 

Now you’re ready to play! Hold onto the string and move your hand around to make the washers spin faster. The object of the game is to keep the washers spinning for as long as possible.
