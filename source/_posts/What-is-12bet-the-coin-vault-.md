#  Who owns the coin vault Belgium? 

The coin vault Belgium has been a hot topic lately due to the high-profile heist that occurred in early 2018. The vault is located in the city of Brussels and is said to be one of the most secure facilities in all of Europe. So far, it has not been confirmed who owns the coin vault, but there are several contenders for the title.

One possible owner is the Belgian government. The vault is reported to have been built specifically for the government, and it would make sense for them to be responsible for its security. However, officials have denied any involvement in the heist and say that they do not know who owns the coin vault.

Another potential owner is BRM Holdings, a company that specializes in securing valuable items. It's possible that BRM Holdings owns the coin vault Belgium, but there is no evidence to support this claim.

At this point, it's anyone's guess as to who actually owns the coin vault. The Belgian government denies any involvement, and BRM Holdings has not made a statement either way. Whoever ends up owning the coin vault will likely face a lot of scrutiny in the coming months.
