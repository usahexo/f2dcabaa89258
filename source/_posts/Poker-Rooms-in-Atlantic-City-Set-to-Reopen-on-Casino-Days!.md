#  Poker Rooms in Atlantic City Set to Reopen on Casino Days!

Atlantic City officials have announced that the poker rooms in the casinos will reopen on Casino Days. This comes as a relief to many poker players who have enjoyed playing in the city’s casinos, but found themselves out of luck when most of the poker rooms closed earlier this year.

According to Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian, the Poker Rooms will be open from 11:00am to 3:00am daily. The announcement was made at a press conference on Wednesday, October 5th.

Mayor Guardian also released a statement, saying: “The reopening of our poker rooms is another positive step forward for Atlantic City and its casino industry. We are committed to providing our players with a top-notch gaming experience and I encourage everyone to come out and take advantage of these great games.”

When asked if there would be any changes to the way the poker rooms are operated, Mayor Guardian said that there are no immediate plans to change anything, but that the city is always looking for ways to improve the gaming experience for its players.

Reaction from the poker community has been overwhelmingly positive, with many players eager to get back to playing in Atlantic City’s casinos. One player said: “I’m glad they’re opening up the poker rooms again. I love playing in Atlantic City – it’s my favorite place to play. I can’t wait to get back there and start swinging some pots!”

#  Poker Players in Atlantic City can Finally Play Again!

Poker players in Atlantic City can finally play again! The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement announced that online poker and casino games will resume on November 21.

Atlantic City casinos were forced to close their online gambling operations in October 2014, when new laws went into effect prohibiting the use of credit cards to fund online gambling transactions.

The new regulations, which were signed into law by Governor Chris Christie in February, allow for the use of debit cards, pre-paid cards and electronic fund transfers to fund online gambling transactions.

"This is great news for New Jersey's gaming industry and especially for Atlantic City," said state Sen. Jim Beach, a sponsor of the legislation. "We have been waiting for this for quite some time and I am pleased that we were able to get it done before the end of the year."

"I'm thrilled that we finally have a solution that allows our players to resume their online gaming activities," said Tony Rodio, president of Tropicana Entertainment Inc., which operates three casinos in Atlantic City. "I would like to thank Senator Jim Beach and all those who worked so hard on this issue for their dedication and commitment to ensuring that our customers could continue to enjoy this important casino experience."
