#  What changes do you see in the legal industry affecting office management?

1. With the increasing popularity of legaltech solutions, there is a need for legal professionals to be technologically savvy. This means that office management staff must also be able to manage and operate these technologies.

2. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the legal industry is growing rapidly. As a result, office management must also be prepared to manage and utilise these technologies.

3. The increasing demand for e-discovery and document review services has led to a rise in the use of contract attorneys. This has created new challenges for office managers, who now have to manage a larger number of attorneys and their associated resources.

4. The rise in alternative legal service providers (including online legal services) has led to an increase in competition for law firms. As a result, law firms are looking for ways to become more efficient and reduce costs. Office management must play a key role in achieving this goal.

#  Are there new technologies or software that can help make your job easier?

It depends on what your job is. If you're a cashier, there are new technologies that can help speed up the checkout process.
