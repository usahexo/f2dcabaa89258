#  How to FC Internazionale Milano: A Guide for MGM Bettors 

If you're looking to make some money by betting on FC Internazionale Milano, then look no further. In this guide, we'll teach you everything you need to know in order to make smart bets on the Nerazzurri.

First and foremost, let's take a look at Inter's recent form. They've been up and down lately, but they do have some very impressive results from this season so far. Their 5-0 win over Chievo Verona is a particular standout, and their 3-0 victory over Lazio was also impressive. Overall, they've picked up 9 wins, 4 draws, and 7 losses in the Serie A this season. This gives them a total of 31 points, putting them in 6th place in the league table.

While they haven't been as consistent as some other teams in the league, they do have some explosive players that can easily lead them to victory on any given matchday. Mauro Icardi is one of these players – he's currently the joint top scorer in Serie A with 16 goals so far this season. And alongside Icardi, Ivan Perisic and Joao Mario are both capable of contributing greatly to Inter's offence.

So now that we know a bit more about Inter and their recent form, let's take a look at some of the key factors that could influence their upcoming matches. One thing to consider is their fixture list – they have some relatively easy matches coming up against Cagliari (away), Hellas Verona (home), Benevento (away), Crotone (home), and Genoa (away). This makes it a good time for them to pick up some points and move up the table.

However, they will also be facing some tough opponents over the next few weeks. They'll be playing Napoli (home), Roma (away), Juventus (home), and Udinese (away). So there will definitely be some interesting matchups coming up which should provide us with plenty of betting opportunities.

Now that we know who Inter are playing and when, let's take a look at how we can bet on them. There are many different ways to bet on football matches, but our focus here will be on three specific types: Match Odds, Handicap Betting ,and Total Goals .

For Match Odds betting , you simply bet on which team you think will win the match. The odds are usually displayed as either decimal odds or American odds . For example, if Inter are listed at 2.50 decimal odds or +150 American odds , this means that for every £2 you bet, you will receive £3 back if Inter win (including your original stake). So if you think that Inter will win, then betting on them would be the logical choice. 

For Handicap Betting , you are betting on which team will cover the handicap . This works by giving one team an advantage or disadvantage before the match begins . For example, if Inter are given a handicap of -1 goal , then this means that they must win by 2 goals or more in order to cover the handicap . Conversely , if they were given a handicap of +1 goal , then they would only need to draw or lose by 1 goal in order to cover the handicap .  

Finally , there is Total Goals betting . With this type of wager , you are betting on how many goals will be scored in the entire match . So for example , if you think there will be 2 goals or less scored in the match , then you would bet under 2 goals . Conversely , if you think there will be 3 goals or more scored in the match , then you would bet over 3 goals . 

Now that we've looked at all three types of bets, let's take a closer look at each one so that you can better understand how they work: 

Match Odds: As mentioned earlier, with Match Odds betting you simply bet on which team you think will win the match . The odds for this type of wager are typically displayed as either decimal odds or American odds . Decimal odds are simply just another way of expressing fractional odds , while American Odds are just another way of expressing decimal odds . So for example, if Team A is listed at 2.50 decimal odds or +150 American odds , it means that for every £2 wagered Team A will payout £3 plus your original stake ($2 bet would payout $3 plus original $2 stake = $5 total). If Team B is listed at 3.00 decimal odds or +200 American odds it means that for every £2 wagered Team B will payout £3 plus your original stake ($2 bet would payout $6 plus original $2 stake = $8 total). As you can see from these examples, American Odds offer slightly higher payouts than their decimal
