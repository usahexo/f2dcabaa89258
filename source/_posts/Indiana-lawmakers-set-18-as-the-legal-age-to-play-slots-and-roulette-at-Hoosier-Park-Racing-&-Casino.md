#  Indiana lawmakers set 18 as the legal age to play slots and roulette at Hoosier Park Racing & Casino

Indiana lawmakers have set 18 as the legal age to play slots and roulette at Hoosier Park Racing & Casino. The racing and casino facility is located in Anderson, Indiana.

A spokeswoman for the casino said that they were in favor of the change, but they would work with the state to make sure that those under 18 would not be able to gamble at the casino.

Gov. Eric Holcomb said that he was supportive of the change, as it brings Indiana in line with many other states.

The change does not impact those who are playing bingo or other games at the casino. It only impacts those who are playing slots and roulette.

#  UnderageGamblers Banned from playing at Horseshoe Southern Indiana Casino

Horseshoe Southern Indiana Casino has decided to ban underage gamblers from playing at their casino. The casino released a statement earlier this week that states:

"After careful consideration, we have decided to prohibit anyone under the age of 21 from playing at our casino. This new policy goes into effect immediately."

The decision was made in response to concerns raised by parents and other community members about underage gambling at the casino. While the casino does not have an exact breakdown of how many minors are among its gambler population, officials felt it was necessary to ban them in order to protect vulnerable young people.

This ban is not without controversy, as some people feel that it unfairly targets minors who are otherwise law-abiding citizens. Supporters of the ban argue, however, that it is more important to protect children from developing gambling addictions than it is to allow them access to casinos.

The decision comes at a time when gambling is becoming increasingly accessible to young people. With online casinos and state-sponsored lotteries popping up all over the country, it can be difficult for parents to keep their kids away from gambling games.

#  Indiana Raises Minimum Gambling Age to Play Slots and Roulette 

In a unanimous vote on Tuesday, the Indiana Senate raised the minimum gambling age from 18 to 21 for playing slots and roulette at casinos.

Republican Senator Phil Boots said the change was needed to protect young people and their families.

“It is important that we do what we can to protect Hoosiers, especially our young people, from the dangers associated with gambling,” he said in a statement after the vote.

The measure now moves to the House of Representatives for consideration.

Indiana is not alone in increasing its minimum gambling age. Last year, Michigan raised its minimum gambling age to 21 for all forms of gambling. Other states with a minimum gambling age of 21 include Illinois, Louisiana, Oregon and Washington.

Opponents of raising the minimum gambling age say it will only push problem gamblers underground and make it more difficult for them to get help. They also argue that younger people are better able to make informed decisions about gambling than lawmakers give them credit for.

#  18-year-olds can now gamble at Horseshoe Southern Indiana Casino 

In a landmark decision, the Indiana Gaming Commission has ruled that 18-year-olds can now gamble at Horseshoe Southern Indiana Casino. The decision is seen as a victory for casino operators who have been lobbying for the change for years.

The vote, which was unanimous, overturned a ban that had been in place since the casino opened in 1995. The new rule will go into effect immediately and will apply to all forms of gambling, including table games, slots and sports betting.

Supporters of the change argue that it is unfair to prohibit young adults from gambling when they can go to any other business in the state and buy alcohol. They also point out that many other states allow 18-year-olds to gamble and that there is no evidence that allowing them to gamble leads to increased rates of addiction or crime.

Opponents of the change argue that gambling is not appropriate for young adults and that they are not mature enough to make informed decisions about their money. They also worry that allowing 18-year-olds to gamble will lead to increased rates of addiction and crime.

It remains to be seen what impact the change will have on Horseshoe Southern Indiana Casino. However, it is likely that other casinos in the state will follow suit and remove their age restrictions on gambling.
