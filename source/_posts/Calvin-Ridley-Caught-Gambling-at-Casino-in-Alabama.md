#  Calvin Ridley Caught Gambling at Casino in Alabama

Alabama Crimson Tide wide receiver Calvin Ridley was reportedly caught gambling at a casino in his home state on Saturday night.

According to multiple sources, Ridley was seen placing bets at the Wind Creek Casino and Hotel in Montgomery. He was accompanied by a group of friends and was observed playing blackjack and electronic poker.

Ridley is coming off a stellar sophomore season in which he hauled in 89 receptions for 1,045 yards and seven touchdowns. He is expected to be one of the top players in the country this upcoming season and is currently considered the No. 2 wide receiver prospect for the 2019 NFL Draft.

This is not the first time that Ridley has been involved in off-the-field issues. In May of 2017, he was cited for possession of marijuana paraphernalia.

Alabama coach Nick Saban released a statement on Sunday regarding Ridley's latest incident.

"We are aware of the situation involving Calvin Ridley and we are still gathering information," Saban said. "We are very disappointed any time one of our players makes an unwise decision."

Ridley has not yet commented on the matter.

#  Calvin Ridley Gambling: Nick Saban Comments on WR's Actions

Alabama Crimson Tide wide receiver Calvin Ridley has come under fire this offseason for his actions at a casino in Biloxi, Mississippi. Head coach Nick Saban addressed the issue at Alabama's fan day on Saturday.

"I'm not happy about it," Saban said. "Nobody's happy about it. It's not what we want our players to do."

Ridley was photographed at the casino table on April 28 and 29. The photos quickly made the rounds on social media and sparked criticism from some Tide fans.

Ridley isn't the only Alabama player to make headlines this offseason. Running back Bo Scarbrough and defensive lineman Da'Shawn Hand were both arrested on alcohol-related charges in late May.

Saban said he has spoken to all three players about their off-the-field issues.

"We've had conversations with all these guys," Saban said. "I'm not going to get into all the details of it, but I am disappointed and we are going to continue to try to help them learn how to make better decisions."

Ridley, a junior, is considered one of the top receivers in college football. He caught 63 passes for 967 yards and five touchdowns last season.

#  How Did Calvin Ridley Get Caught Gambling?

In order to get caught gambling, Calvin Ridley had to make a few mistakes. Most importantly, he had to put himself in a situation where he could be caught. And that's exactly what he did.

Ridley was gambling at a casino in Atlantic City, which is not far from his hometown of Fort Lauderdale. That's not the only mistake he made though. He was also caught on camera. And as we all know, cameras never lie.

So how did Ridley get caught gambling? It all started with an anonymous tip to the police. Someone apparently recognized Ridley and tipped off the authorities. They then alerted the casino, and the rest is history.

Ridley has since issued an apology, but it may be too little too late. He could face serious penalties from both the NFL and the casino, and his career may be in jeopardy.

Alabama wide receiver Calvin Ridley has admitted to gambling and apologized for his actions.
"I apologize to my coaches, teammates and everyone associated with the University of Alabama," Ridley said in a statement. "I know I let down my family, my coaches and my teammates. Gambling is not something that I will ever do again."

Ridley, who is considered one of the top receivers in college football, is a sophomore at Alabama. He had 45 receptions for 720 yards and seven touchdowns last season.

According to NCAA rules, players are not allowed to gamble on sports. Ridley could face disciplinary action from the university and the NCAA.

#  Calvin Ridley's Gambling Incident Could Result in Team Suspension

 Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley is facing a possible suspension after he was involved in a gambling incident at an Atlantic City casino.

The NFL has a strict policy against gambling, and it is likely that Ridley will be disciplined for his actions.

This could be a major setback for the Falcons offense, as Ridley has emerged as one of their top players this season.

Ridley is currently tied for the team lead in touchdown receptions, and he has been a big part of the Falcons' success this year.

If he is suspended, the Falcons will have to rely on other players to fill the void.

Players like Mohamed Sanu and Julio Jones will have to step up and carry the load for the Atlanta offense.

The Falcons are currently in first place in the NFC South, but a suspension for Ridley could derail their playoff hopes.
