#  Cavaliers' odds of winning NBA title fall to 2-1 after Game 1 loss

The Cleveland Cavaliers' odds of winning the NBA title have fallen to 2-1 after their Game 1 loss to the Golden State Warriors, according to the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook.

Before the series began, the Cavs were favored to win the title, with a 6-5 chance. But they are now just a slight favorite over the Warriors, who are 3-1.

The Warriors are also still favored to win the series, with a 70 percent chance of victory, while the Cavs have a 30 percent chance.

If you want to put some money down on this series, you can currently get the Warriors at -240 and the Cavs at +200.

#  Warriors still favored to win NBA Finals, but Cavaliers' odds improve with Kyrie Irving back

The Golden State Warriors remain the favorites to win the NBA Finals, but their odds have improved since Kyrie Irving's return.

Irving, who was sidelined for the first three games of the Finals with a knee injury, made his return in Game 4 and led the Cavaliers to a win. Cleveland is now a +650 underdog to win the series, while Golden State is still at -200.

 Irving's return was a big boost for the Cavaliers, who had been struggling without him. LeBron James has carried most of the load offensively in Irving's absence, and he was able to take a break in Game 4 with Irving back in the lineup.

"It was great to have Kyrie back," James said after the game. "He makes our team so much better."

James scored 41 points in Game 4, but it was Irving who led the comeback effort in the fourth quarter. He scored 13 points in the final period and hit several clutch shots down the stretch to help Cleveland pull out the victory.

"Kyrie is one of those guys who can make something happen out of nothing," James said. "That's what we need out of him."

The Warriors still hold a 2-1 lead in the series, but they may not be able to relax just yet. The Cavaliers are clearly a different team with Irving back in the lineup, and they could make things interesting if they can continue to win games.

#  Odds unchanged on Warriors to win NBA Finals, Cavs remain at 7-2

The Golden State Warriors remain the odds-on favorite to win the 2017 NBA Finals, according to the latest betting lines from Bovada.

Golden State has odds of -220 to win the title, while the Cleveland Cavaliers are second at +180.

There has been very little movement in the odds since the postseason began, with the Warriors and Cavaliers both holding steady at -220 and +180, respectively.

The Celtics (+650), Rockets (+1400) and Spurs (+2000) are all considered longshots to win it all this year.

The Celtics and Rockets have each seen their odds improve slightly since the postseason began, while the Spursâ€™ odds have lengthened somewhat.

#  Cavaliers down 2-1, but their odds of winning the NBA Finals are still 5-1

After taking game three from the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Golden State Warriors are now up 2-1 in the NBA Finals. This means the Cavs have to win four out of the next five games in order to take home the championship. But does this mean they can't win at all?

No, not at all. The Cavs actually still have a 5-1 chance of winning the NBA Finals, according to ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI). In fact, when looking at all teams who have ever been down 2-1 in the Finals, about 54 percent of them have come back to win.

There are a few things that need to happen for the Cavs to pull off this comeback. First and foremost, LeBron James needs to continue playing at an MVP level. He has averaged 32.3 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists per game so far in the Finals and will need to continue his rampage if Cleveland wants to win. Additionally, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love will need to step up their games as well.

The Warriors are a great team, but they're not unbeatable. If Cleveland plays like they're capable of playing, they can definitely win this series.

#  Durant, Westbrook lead Thunder to 3-0 series lead over Spurs; San Antonio's NBA Finals odds now 50-1

The Oklahoma City Thunder took a 3-0 lead in their best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series against the San Antonio Spurs with a 116-105 victory on Thursday night.

The Thunder, led by reigning MVP Kevin Durant and All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook, have looked like the better team in every game of the series so far.

Durant had 36 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for his second triple-double of the playoffs, while Westbrook scored 28 points. Serge Ibaka added 17 points and 11 rebounds for Oklahoma City.

Tony Parker led San Antonio with 23 points, while Tim Duncan had 20 points and 14 rebounds. Manu Ginobili scored 19 points off the bench for the Spurs.

With the loss, San Antonio's odds to win the NBA Finals improved from 15-2 to 50-1 at most sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.

The Thunder, meanwhile, remain as 6/5 favourites to win the West, followed by the Clippers at 5/4 and the Warriors at 2/1.

Oklahoma City will go for a four-game sweep of the Spurs when they host Game 4 on Sunday night.
