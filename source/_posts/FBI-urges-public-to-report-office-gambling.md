#  FBI urges public to report office gambling

The FBI is urging the public to report any office gambling. This came in the form of a Public Service Announcement (PSA) on their official website.

Gambling can take many forms, including betting on sports, playing poker, or buying into a office pool. While it may seem like harmless fun, gambling can quickly become addictive and lead to financial ruin.

Office gambling often goes unreported because people are afraid of being laughed at or punished. The FBI wants you to know that you can report office gambling anonymously, and you will not be punished for doing so.

If you or someone you know is addicted to office gambling, there are resources available to help you get back on your feet. The National Gambling Hotline offers free counseling and support for people battling addiction. You can reach them at 1-800-522-4700.

#  FBI offers tips on how to report office gambling

The statement offers tips on how to report office gambling and what to expect once the report is filed.

Reporting Office Gambling

If you suspect that your office is engaging in illegal gambling activities, there are a few things you can do:

• Call the FBI's 24-hour tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) and ask to speak with an agent in the Organized Crime Unit. You can also submit a tip online at https://tips.fbi.gov/.

• Contact your local FBI field office. To find your local office, visit https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices.

What to Expect After Reporting Office Gambling

Once you have reported office gambling, you can expect the following:

• An FBI agent will contact you to discuss the details of your case.

• The agent will then determine whether or not an investigation is warranted.

• If an investigation is warranted, the agent will work with other law enforcement agencies to gather evidence and build a case against the offenders.


Office gambling can be fun and harmless when it's done in moderation, but when it gets out of hand, it can lead to criminal activities like racketeering and money laundering. If you think your office might be engaging in illegal gambling activities, don't hesitate to call the FBI's 24-hour tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).

#  FBI warns of the dangers of office gambling

The FBI has released a warning to businesses about the dangers of office gambling. The warning comes after a number of high-profile arrests of businesspeople who have been caught gambling at work.

Gambling at work can be extremely dangerous to businesses, as it can lead to lost productivity, fights between employees, and even theft. In some cases, businesses have even gone out of business as a result of employee gambling.

The FBI is urging businesses to put in place policies prohibiting gambling at work, and to take disciplinary action against employees who engage in this behavior. Businesses should also consider installing software that can detect whether employees are accessing gambling websites from their work computers.

If you are an employee, it is important to remember that gambling at work is not only illegal, but it can also get you fired. If you are caught gambling at work, you should immediately stop and apologize to your boss. You may also want to seek counseling or treatment for any addiction you may have.
