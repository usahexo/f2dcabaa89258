#  Europe's Favorite Casino Game - European Roulette Origins

European roulette is one of the oldest casino games and probably the most popular one in Europe. It's derived from an earlier game called Roly-Poly[^1] which was popularized in France in the 1700s.

Roulette means "little wheel" in French, and the game is played on a wheel with 37 or 38 numbered slots, depending on whether you're playing American or European roulette. Players bet on where they think the ball will end up after the wheel is spun.

The game became popular in America in the early 1800s, and some Hollywood legends even claim that it was responsible for financing Clark Gable's rise to fame!

There are a variety of betting options available in roulette, including inside and outside bets. Some of the more common types of bets include:

* Straight up - Betting on a single number

* Split - Betting on two adjacent numbers

* Street - Betting on three numbers in a row

* Corner - Betting on four numbers that form a square

* Six Line - Betting on six numbers that form two adjacent rows
5 The odds of winning depend on the type of bet you make, but overall, European roulette is slightly more favourable to players than American roulette. There are also different betting strategies that can be used to improve your chances of winning, such as covering as many possible outcomes as possible with your bets.     Now that you know all about European roulette, it's time to give it a try at your favourite online casino!

#  European Roulette - The French Connection

In roulette, there are a number of betting options available on the table layout. One of the most popular choices is to bet on a specific number, in which case you are betting that the ball will land on that number when it eventually stops spinning.

There are 38 numbers on the wheel in European roulette, and players can bet on any one of them or on a range of numbers. The odds of winning change depending on which bets are made, but there are betting strategies that can improve your chances.

To win at roulette, you need to make informed decisions about where to place your bets. Some numbers are more likely to come up than others, so by picking the right ones you can increase your chances of winning.

The most important thing is to familiarise yourself with the different betting options and understand the odds associated with each one. There’s no point betting on a number that has low odds, as you won’t make any money if it comes up.

Instead, try to focus on tables where the odds are slightly more favourable for the player. That doesn’t mean you should avoid betting on low odds numbers altogether - just be aware that your potential profits will be lower.

In European roulette, there are two main types of bets: inside and outside bets. Inside bets are placed on specific numbers, while outside bets involve betting on combinations of numbers.

Here’s a rundown of some of the most popular inside and outside bets:

Straight Up: A bet on a single number (e.g. 7)
5 Numbers Bet: A bet on five adjoining numbers (e.g. 1-2-3-4-5)
Line Bet: A bet on six consecutive numbers (e.g. 17-18-19-20-21-22)
 corners: A bet on four adjoining numbers (e.g., 10-11-13-14)
Street Bet: A bet covering three consecutive numbers (e.g., 8-9-10)

#  How European Roulette Spread Across Europe

The history of Roulette can be traced back to ancient China, where the game was known as “the wheel of destiny.” It slowly spread to Europe in the 17th century, and by the 18th century, it had become a popular casino game.

European Roulette is played with a spinning wheel and a ball. The player bets on where they think the ball will land after the wheel has stopped spinning. If their guess is correct, they win.

European Roulette first appeared in France in the early 18th century. It quickly spread to other parts of Europe, and by the end of the 18th century, it was popular in casinos across the continent. In fact, European Roulette is even said to have been played at Napoleon’s court!

There are several different variants of European Roulette, but all of them share the same basic rules. The game continues to be popular today, and can be found in casinos all over the world.

#  A Brief History of the European Roulette Table

The roulette table as we know it today first appeared in the casinos of France during the 18th century. However, its origins can be traced back much further to ancient China. There, a game known as 'roulette' involved spinning a large wheel with 36 slots, each holding a different counter. Players would then bet on which slot the ball would fall into after the spin.

While the game quickly caught on in China, it didn't make its way to Europe until much later. In fact, it's believed that French mathematician Blaise Pascal was the first to bring roulette to the continent in 1655. He is also credited with inventing the modern roulette wheel, which featured slots numbering from 0 to 36 (in contrast to the Chinese wheel which only had slots from 1-36).

Interestingly, at this point roulette was still considered a game of chance rather than skill. It wasn't until the early 19th century that casino owners started to introduce betting strategies in an effort to tilt the odds in their favour. This led to Roulette becoming one of the most popular casino games of all time.

Today, Roulette remains a staple of casino gaming worldwide and continues to intrigue players with its combination of luck and strategy.
