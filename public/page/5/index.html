<li><p>With the increasing popularity of legaltech solutions, there is a need for legal professionals to be technologically savvy. This means that office management staff must also be able to manage and operate these technologies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the legal industry is growing rapidly. As a result, office management must also be prepared to manage and utilise these technologies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The increasing demand for e-discovery and document review services has led to a rise in the use of contract attorneys. This has created new challenges for office managers, who now have to manage a larger number of attorneys and their associated resources.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The rise in alternative legal service providers (including online legal services) has led to an increase in competition for law firms. As a result, law firms are looking for ways to become more efficient and reduce costs. Office management must play a key role in achieving this goal.</p>
