        <h1 id="Trump-Casino-Demolished-by-NBA-League-Officials-Due-to-Possible-Corruption"><a href="#Trump-Casino-Demolished-by-NBA-League-Officials-Due-to-Possible-Corruption" class="headerlink" title="Trump Casino Demolished by NBA League Officials Due to Possible Corruption"></a>Trump Casino Demolished by NBA League Officials Due to Possible Corruption</h1><p>The long-standing Trump Casino, one of the largest in the United States, has been demolished by NBA league officials. The reason for the demolition was due to suspicions of corruption involving the casino’s ownership.</p>
<p>The casino was initially put up for sale in early 2017, but no buyers were found. It is now being alleged that potential buyers pulled out after it became known that the casino was under investigation by the NBA. league officials have not commented on any possible connections between the sale and the ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>The Trump Casino has been in operation since 1990 and was one of the first casinos to be built outside of Atlantic City. It is estimated that over the years, the casino has generated over $1 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, who was a part owner of the casino until 2004, has denied any involvement in or knowledge of any illegal activity.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Casino-Shut-Down-After-Illegal-Activities-Uncovered"><a href="#Trump-Casino-Shut-Down-After-Illegal-Activities-Uncovered" class="headerlink" title="Trump Casino Shut Down After Illegal Activities Uncovered"></a>Trump Casino Shut Down After Illegal Activities Uncovered</h1><p>The Trump Taj Mahal casino, once a popular destination for tourists and Atlantic City residents, was shut down after investigators discovered widespread illegal activities taking place at the casino.</p>
<p>According to reports, the casino was engaged in money laundering, fraud, and other illegal activities. In addition, the casino had failed to pay out millions of dollars in winnings to customers.</p>
<p>After years of financial troubles, the Trump Taj Mahal finally closed its doors in October 2016. This closure marks another chapter in the saga of Donald Trump’s failed business ventures.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Casino-Destroyed-by-NBA-to-Protect-Integrity-of-the-Game"><a href="#Trump-Casino-Destroyed-by-NBA-to-Protect-Integrity-of-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Trump Casino Destroyed by NBA to Protect Integrity of the Game"></a>Trump Casino Destroyed by NBA to Protect Integrity of the Game</h1><p>The NBA’s decision to destroy the Trump casino was a calculated move to protect the integrity of the game.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has a history of associating with gambling and casinos, which is why the NBA was concerned about his involvement in the Trump casino. The NBA doesn’t want any hint of impropriety associated with its games, and they certainly didn’t want their brand tarnished by Trump’s questionable business practices.</p>
<p>The Trump casino was a complete disaster and it’s no surprise that it went bankrupt. Not only did Trump have a history of shady business deals, but he also had a terrible track record when it came to managing casinos. The casino was plagued by financial troubles and construction delays, and it ultimately failed to attract enough guests to turn a profit.</p>
<p>The NBA’s decision to destroy the casino was likely motivated by more than just concerns about the integrity of the game. It’s also possible that the NBA didn’t want to be affiliated with Trump given his controversial statements about immigrants and other minority groups.</p>
<h1 id="Demolition-of-Trump-Casino-Nets-500-Million-in-Taxpayer-Savings"><a href="#Demolition-of-Trump-Casino-Nets-500-Million-in-Taxpayer-Savings" class="headerlink" title="Demolition of Trump Casino Nets $500 Million in Taxpayer Savings"></a>Demolition of Trump Casino Nets $500 Million in Taxpayer Savings</h1><p>The demolition of the Trump Casino in Atlantic City, NJ has yielded a positive result for taxpayers with the net taxpayers savings estimated at $500 million. The work began in May of 2018 and was completed this month, September 2018.</p>
<p>Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian said in a statement:<br>“The Trump Taj Mahal was an eyesore and its demolition is a big win for Atlantic City. I am grateful to our state and federal partners who helped make this happen. Not only have we created hundreds of jobs and generated economic activity, but we’ve also saved taxpayers millions of dollars.”</p>
<p>In addition to the savings for taxpayers, the demolition has created over 1,000 jobs and has resulted in $27 million in economic activity.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Casino’s-Demise-Highlights-Need-for-Reform-in-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#Trump-Casino’s-Demise-Highlights-Need-for-Reform-in-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Trump Casino’s Demise Highlights Need for Reform in Sports Gambling"></a>Trump Casino’s Demise Highlights Need for Reform in Sports Gambling</h1><p>The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino this past October marked the end of an era in the world of U.S. gambling. The casino, which opened its doors in 1990, was one of the first in the country to offer legalized sports betting. At a time when Atlantic City was the only game in town for legal gambling, Trump’s casino helped to usher in a new age of gaming and entertainment.</p>
<p>However, as with many things associated with Donald Trump, the good times didn’t last forever. In recent years, the Taj Mahal had been struggling to keep up with its competition, largely due to its outdated facilities and diminishing customer base. With little hope of turning things around, Trump’s company decided to shut down the casino for good.</p>
<p>While the closure of the Taj Mahal is certainly a setback for Atlantic City, it may also be a sign of things to come in the world of sports gambling. In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards legalization and regulation of sports betting, with several states currently considering legislation on the issue.</p>
<p>This trend is being driven by two major factors: changing public opinion and increasing demand from consumers. A poll released earlier this year by ESPN showed that 60% of all Americans now support legalizing sports betting nationwide. This is a significant shift from just a few years ago, when most people opposed it.</p>
<p>The other factor at play is increasing demand from consumers. Gambling on sporting events has always been popular, but it has exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to online platforms like DraftKings and FanDuel. These platforms have made it easier than ever for people to place bets on their favorite teams, and they have generated millions of dollars in revenue for their operators.</p>
<p>As more and more states legalize sports betting, it will become increasingly difficult for casinos like Trump’s Taj Mahal to survive. The days when casinos could simply offer sports betting as an afterthought are coming to an end, and operators will need to offer more innovative products and services if they want to stay competitive.</p>
<p>This is not only good news for consumers but also for regulators who have long been calling for increased oversight of the gambling industry. With sports betting becoming increasingly mainstream, there is a greater need for regulation and consumer protection measures to ensure that people are treated fairly and that no one is taken advantage of.</p>
<p>In short, while the closure of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino is certainly disappointing, it may also be a sign of things to come in the world of sports gambling. As public opinion shifts and demand continues to grow, we can expect to see more legalized gambling across the country – including more casinos offering sports betting as a central component of their business model</p>

In this article, we will walk you through the steps necessary to create an online blackjack game that features surrendering.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-the-Game"><a href="#Creating-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Creating the Game"></a>Creating the Game</h2><ol>
<li><p>The first step is to create a new file and name it “surrender.js.” This file will contain all of the code necessary for our game.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, we need to declare some variables. The first variable will be an array of objects that represent each player’s hand. The second variable will be an array of objects that represent the dealer’s hand. The third variable will be an integer that represents the number of decks in use.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>var players = []; var dealers = []; var Deck = 52; //number of cards in a deck</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The next step is to create a function that will deal cards to both the players and dealers hands. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a dealerIndex . It will also return an object that contains information about the card dealt. This function should look like this:</li>
</ol>
<p>function deal(playerIndex, dealerIndex) { //dealer’s cards for (var i = 0; i &lt; Deck; i++) { if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 11) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “clubs” }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 1) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “spades” }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 2) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “hearts” }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 3) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “diamonds” }); } } //returns an object with info about the card dealt return { rank : dealers[dealerIndex][0], suit : dealers[dealerIndex][1] }; }</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The next step is to create a function that will determine whether or not a player can surrender their hand. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a dealer Index . It should return true if the player wants to surrender and false if they do not want to surrender. This function should look like this:</li>
</ol>
<p>function canSurrender(playerindex, dealerindex) { //check each card for (var i = 0; i &lt; players[playerindex].cards().length; ++i) { //if card is 10 or ace if (players[playerindex].cards()[i] &gt;= 10 &amp;&amp; players[playerindex].cards() [i] &lt;= Ace) return true; } //if all cards are low value // conclude player cannot surrender if (!players[playerindex].hasMoreCards()) return false; }</p>
<p> xtrue  } </p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Next, we need to create a function that will allow players to place bets on the game. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a betAmount . It should update the players balance accordingly and also increase the betAmount by the betAmount amount when called again later in the game. This function should look like this: </li>
</ol>
<p>function placeBet(playerindex, betAmount) { //update player’s balance players[playerindex].balance += betAmount; //increment betAmount by amount of betAmount so subsequent calls will increase amount by same value betAmount += betAmount; };</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Finally, we need to create our main() function which will control the flow of our game. This function should accept two parameters: an Array of Players and an Array of Dealers . It should first initialize all variables then call our other functions as needed. The main() function should look like this: </li>
</ol>
<p>function main(players, dealers) { //initialize variables Deck = 52; players = []; dealers = []; for (var i = 0; i &lt; Deck; ++i) { players push({ rank : “Ace”, suit : “spades”}); } for (var j=0 ;j&lt;Deck ;++j){ decks push({ rank : j % 13 + 1, suit : “clubs”}); } for (var k=0 ;k&lt;Deck ;++k){ decks push({ rank : k % 13 + 1, suit : “diamonds”}); }; init(); console .log(“Players:\t”, players); console .log(“Dealers:\t”, dealers); while (!isGameOver()) { processInput(); deal(); updateDisplay(); place</p>

Considering that then, I’ve been asked by many people how to develop the same game but with a unique house edge. So in this post, I’ll demonstrate how you can develop your own on the web crypto casino VIP blackjack game with surrender in minutes making use of my code as a starting point.</p>
<h1 id="Before-We-Start"><a href="#Before-We-Start" class="headerlink" title="Before We Start"></a>Before We Start</h1><p>If you want to follow along and create your own game, you will first need to have some basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, you will also require a local development environment set-up which includes Node.js and NPM. If you are not familiar with these technologies, don’t worry - there are plenty of online tutorials which can walk you through the process.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-the-Game-Board"><a href="#Creating-the-Game-Board" class="headerlink" title="Creating the Game Board"></a>Creating the Game Board</h1><p>The first thing we need to do is create the HTML template for our game board. This will include the layout of our game grid as well as the labels for each column and row. Open up your favorite text editor and create a new file called “game-board.html”. Next, insert the following code into the file:</p>
<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <title>Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack</title> </head> <body> <div class="game-board"> <h1>Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack</h1> <table class="game-board-table"> <tr><th colspan="2">Game Board</th></tr> <tr><th rowspan="2">Column 1</th><th rowspan="2">Column 2</th><th rowspan="2">Column 3</th><th rowspan="2"></th></tr> <tr><td colspan="3">Number 1</td></tr> <tr><td colspan="3">Number 2</td></tr> <tr><td colspan="3">Number 3</td></tr> </table> </div> </body> </html>

<p>Save this file in your project folder. The code above creates a simple HTML table which will be used to display our game board. We have also included some basic styling which will give our table a neater look. You can see a preview of what this looks like below:</p>
<p>Now that we have our game board in place, let’s start coding up the functionality for our game.</p>
<h1 id="Coding-Up-the-Game-Logic"><a href="#Coding-Up-the-Game-Logic" class="headerlink" title="Coding Up the Game Logic"></a>Coding Up the Game Logic</h1><p>We will be using JavaScript to code up the game logic for our blackjack game. Open up a new file called “game.js” and insert the following code into it:</p>
<p>var GAME_OPTIONS = { // Set the maximum number of players allowed in the game numPlayers: 5, // Set up arrays to store player data playerData: [], dealerData: [], // Create an array to store player’s current hand data currentHandData: [], }; function getCoin() { return Math.floor(Math.random()<em>1000000000).toString(10); } function dealCard(playerId) { // Deal card to player id var dealerIndex = Math.floor((playerId - 1) / 2); var dealerCard = cards[dealerIndex]; return dealerCard; } function hit() { // Called when user wants to hit currentHandData[playerId][0]++; if (currentHandData[playerId][0] &gt; 21) { // Player has gone bust currentHandData[playerId] = []; } } function stand() { // Called when user wants to stand currentHandData[playerId] = []; } functiondoubleDown() { /</em> Make sure player is allowed to double down <em>/ if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 0) { alert(“You cannot double down.”); return; } /</em> Update hand data */ currentHandData[playerId][1] <em>= 2; /</em> Draw another card <em>/ dealCard(playerId); } function split() { /</em> Make sure player is allowed to split <em>/ if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 11 || currentHandData[playerId][1] === 12) { alert(“You cannot split.”); return; } /</em> Update hand data <em>/ currentHandData[playerId][1] = 0; /</em> Draw another card */ dealCard(playerId); } function Surrender() { if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 15) { alert(“You cannot Surrender.”); return; } currentHandData[playerID][1]=0; } window.onload = init;</p>

Thanks to its simple rules, online blackjack is a great game for beginners and experienced players alike. In this article we will show you how to setup an online blackjack game with surrender in less than five minutes.</p>
<h2 id="Setting-Up-the-Game"><a href="#Setting-Up-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up the Game"></a>Setting Up the Game</h2><p>The first step is to create a new table. To do this, click on the “Tables” tab and then select “Create Table”.</p>
<p>Enter a name for your table and set the minimum and maximum bet sizes. For this example we will set the minimum bet size to $1 and the maximum bet size to $100. Click on “Create Table” to create the table.</p>
<p>Next, we need to add some players to the table. To do this, click on the “Players” tab and then select “Add Player”.</p>
<p>Enter a name for your player and then click on “Add Player”. Repeat this process until you have added all of the players you want to your table.</p>
<h2 id="Playing-the-Game"><a href="#Playing-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Playing the Game"></a>Playing the Game</h2><p>Now that our game is set up, it’s time to play! The basic rules of online blackjack are as follows: - The player is dealt two cards face up - The player can either stand (do nothing) or hit (take another card) - The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over - If the player goes over 21, they lose - If the player stands, their total is compared against that of the dealer - If the player beats the dealer, they win - If the player loses, they lose their bet amount </p>
<p>To play blackjack, click on one of your players and then click on either “Hit” or “Stand”. When you are done playing your turn, press “Pass” so that it will be the next player’s turn.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in playing blackjack online, there are a few things you need to know first. In this article, we’ll discuss how to create an online blackjack game that features surrendering as an option. We’ll also cover what you need to do to get your game up and running. So let’s get started!</p>
<h1 id="Setting-Up-the-Game-1"><a href="#Setting-Up-the-Game-1" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up the Game"></a>Setting Up the Game</h1><p>To create a blackjack game that features surrendering, you first need to set up the game properly. This includes creating the necessary files and folders, as well as setting up the correct file permissions. Here are the steps you need to take:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new folder on your web server and name it “blackjack-surrender”. This is where your game files will reside.</li>
<li>Inside the “blackjack-surrender” folder, create another folder named “images”. This is where your game images will reside.</li>
<li>Inside the “blackjack-surrender” folder, create a file named “config.php” and save it in plain text format. This file will contain your game configuration settings. </li>
<li>Copy all of the files from the supplied “src” folder into your “blackjack-surrender” folder. </li>
<li>Set proper file permissions for all files in your “blackjack-surrender” folder using CHMOD notation .755 or 755 for read/write/execute for owner, group, and world; 664 or 664 for read/write for owner and group; 444 or 444 for read only for owner and group).<br>The following is an example line of CHMOD notation: chmod 755 images/card_back_left_spades_onlonely1 .jpg<br>This will give everyone Read/Write access to the image file located at images/card_back_left_spades_onlonely1 .jpg </li>
<li>If you are using a MySQL database to store player data, create a new database table named “blackjack_surrender” and add the following columns: id – INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT; player_name – VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL; bet – DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT ‘0′ NULL; chips – DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT ‘0′ NULL;created – TIMESTAMP NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;  </li>
<li>If you are not using a MySQL database to store player data, skip this step.<br>8 ) Edit the file config.php with your own settings. Be sure to include all required settings (see below). </li>
<li>Upload all of your files to your web server using FTP software (e.g., FileZilla).<br>10 ) Test your game by opening it in a web browser on your local computer (localhost). Make sure everything works as expected before going live on a public server! </li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have our game set up properly, let’s take a look at some of the important configurable options that are available to us in config.php .</p>
<h1 id="Game-Configuration-Options"><a href="#Game-Configuration-Options" class="headerlink" title="Game Configuration Options"></a>Game Configuration Options</h1><p>The following is a list of all configurable options that are available in config.php :</p>
<p>dbhost – The hostname or IP address of your MySQL database server dbuser – The username that has access to your MySQL database dbpass – The password for the dbuser above dbname – The name of your MySQL database tableprefix – A prefix that will be appended to all table names in your MySQL database (optional) enabledSurrendering – Whether or not surrendering is enabled (true = enabled, false = disabled) allowedSurrenderPercentage - The allowed surrender percentage (must be between 0% and 100%) hitOrStandAfterSplitting - Whether or not players are allowed to hit after splitting (true = allowed, false = not allowed) splitLimit - The maximum number of splits that can be made (defaults to 2) doubleDownLimit - The maximum number of doubles that can be made (defaults to 1</p>

While the game is loads of fun, it can also be tricky figuring out how to start the casino heist in Monaco. </p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is to make sure you have all of the necessary equipment. In addition to yourclothes, you will need a disguise, toolbox, smoke grenade, and appropiate heist skills. Once you have everything you need, head to the casino and walk in like you own the place.Next, find the security room and hack into the security cameras. This will give you a view of the entire casino so that you can plan your heist. </p>
<p>Now it’s time to start robbing some casinos! First, head to the vault and steal whatever money or jewels are inside. Be careful not to get caught by the security guards! Next, make your way to the poker room and take all of the chips. Finally, head to the bar and take whatever liquor or cigarettes are on display. Once you have robbed all three casinos, it’s time to make your escape! </p>
<p>Make your way back to the security room and hack into the locked doors. This will allow you and your team to escape without getting caught by the police. Finally, celebrate your successful casino heist with a few rounds of Monaco: What’s Yours is Mine!</p>

The vault is located in the city of Brussels and is said to be one of the most secure facilities in all of Europe. So far, it has not been confirmed who owns the coin vault, but there are several contenders for the title.</p>
<p>One possible owner is the Belgian government. The vault is reported to have been built specifically for the government, and it would make sense for them to be responsible for its security. However, officials have denied any involvement in the heist and say that they do not know who owns the coin vault.</p>
<p>Another potential owner is BRM Holdings, a company that specializes in securing valuable items. It’s possible that BRM Holdings owns the coin vault Belgium, but there is no evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>At this point, it’s anyone’s guess as to who actually owns the coin vault. The Belgian government denies any involvement, and BRM Holdings has not made a statement either way. Whoever ends up owning the coin vault will likely face a lot of scrutiny in the coming months.</p>

It is one of the most well-known and reputable online betting companies in Asia. The company was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Philippines.</p>
<p>12bet was originally named Asia Sports Betting Company Limited. In 2012, the company rebranded to 12bet to better represent its global reach. 12bet offers a wide range of sports betting options, including live betting, as well as casino and poker games.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-climate-like-in-Mississippi"><a href="#What-is-the-climate-like-in-Mississippi" class="headerlink" title="What is the climate like in Mississippi?"></a>What is the climate like in Mississippi?</h1><p>The climate in Mississippi is humid subtropical. This means the summers are hot and muggy, while the winters are mild and short. Precipitation is common throughout the year, but it is especially high in the spring and fall.</p>
<h1 id="Which-players-are-most-likely-to-win-the-NBA-Championship"><a href="#Which-players-are-most-likely-to-win-the-NBA-Championship" class="headerlink" title="Which players are most likely to win the NBA Championship?"></a>Which players are most likely to win the NBA Championship?</h1><p>The NBA playoffs are underway, and there are a number of teams with a chance to win the championship. But which players are most likely to lead their team to victory?</p>
<p>In the Eastern Conference, the Cleveland Cavaliers are the clear favourites. LeBron James is one of the best players in the league, and he has led the Cavaliers to the finals three years in a row. Kyrie Irving is also a top-tier player, and he should be able to carry the team if James falters.</p>
<p>In the Western Conference, the Golden State Warriors are overwhelming favourites. Stephen Curry is one of the best shooters in NBA history, and Kevin Durant is one of the most versatile players in the league. The Warriors also have a deep bench, which gives them a major advantage over their opponents.</p>
<p>Regardless of who wins the championship, it should be an exciting playoffs. There are a number of talented players who could lead their team to victory.</p>
<h1 id="How-popular-is-basketball-in-Mississippi-compared-to-other-sports"><a href="#How-popular-is-basketball-in-Mississippi-compared-to-other-sports" class="headerlink" title="How popular is basketball in Mississippi compared to other sports?"></a>How popular is basketball in Mississippi compared to other sports?</h1><p>Basketball is a very popular sport in Mississippi compared to other sports. According to the Mississippi High School Activities Association, there are over 160 schools that have boys’ basketball programs and over 170 schools with girls’ basketball programs. This is a considerably higher number than for any other sport. For example, there are only 103 schools that have football programs and only 66 schools with baseball programs. </p>
<p>There are several reasons for this disparity. For one, basketball is a relatively easy sport to play. All you need is a ball and a court (or even just a driveway). It does not require expensive equipment or special facilities like football or baseball do. </p>
<p>Another reason is that basketball is an exciting sport to watch. There is always lots of action, making it fun for spectators. And finally, Mississippi has lots of great high school basketball players. The state has produced several NBA stars, including LeBron James and Kobe Bryant. This helps to attract attention to the sport and encourages people to get involved in it.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-you-think-is-the-biggest-challenge-facing-basketball-in-Mississippi"><a href="#What-do-you-think-is-the-biggest-challenge-facing-basketball-in-Mississippi" class="headerlink" title="What do you think is the biggest challenge facing basketball in Mississippi?"></a>What do you think is the biggest challenge facing basketball in Mississippi?</h1><p>When it comes to basketball in Mississippi, the biggest challenge is the lack of quality coaching. There are very few programs that have consistently produced successful teams and players at the high school and college levels. This is due in part to a lack of resources, but also a lack of qualified coaches. Too often, coaches are hired because they are friends with someone in administration or they have a strong playing background, rather than because they have experience teaching the game and developing young athletes. As a result, many players never receive the proper instruction or motivation necessary to reach their full potential. Until this issue is addressed, basketball will continue to lag behind other sports in the state.</p>
