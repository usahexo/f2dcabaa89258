        <h1 id="Nuggets-Seeing-Red-In-1st-Half"><a href="#Nuggets-Seeing-Red-In-1st-Half" class="headerlink" title="Nuggets Seeing Red In 1st Half"></a>Nuggets Seeing Red In 1st Half</h1><p>The Nuggets are coming off of a big win over the Timberwolves on Sunday, but they were not able to keep the momentum going in the first half against the Rockets. Denver was outscored by 19 points in the first half and found themselves in a hole they could not dig themselves out of.</p>
<p>The Rockets were red hot from 3-point range in the first half, shooting 11-of-21 (52.4 percent) from long range. James Harden was especially dangerous, knocking down 5-of-7 shots from beyond the arc. Trevor Ariza added three 3-pointers of his own as Houston raced out to a 67-48 halftime lead.</p>
<p>“They made every shot in that first half,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “We talked about it at halftime - let’s make them take tough shots.”</p>
<p>Denver made a run at the Rockets in the third quarter, trimming the deficit to 10 points, but could get no closer. The Rockets answered with another big run to push their lead back to 20 and cruised to a 119-105 victory.</p>
<p>Nikola Jokic led the Nuggets with 21 points and 14 rebounds, while Jamal Murray added 20 points and six assists. Gary Harris scored 18 points off the bench, but no other Nugget reached double digits.</p>
<p>“We’ve just got to do better as a unit,” Murray said. “I think we were playing too individualized instead of playing as a team.”</p>
<p>Houston was led by Harden’s 30 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. Chris Paul added 23 points and 10 assists for the Rockets, who have now won six straight games.</p>
<p>“We can’t just rely on James all night,” Paul said. “We need other guys to step up.”</p>
<p>The Nuggets will try to get back on track on Wednesday when they host the Spurs at the Pepsi Center</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Nuggets-vs-Mavericks-Final-Score-104-114"><a href="#NBA-Nuggets-vs-Mavericks-Final-Score-104-114" class="headerlink" title="NBA - Nuggets vs Mavericks Final Score 104-114"></a>NBA - Nuggets vs Mavericks Final Score 104-114</h1><p>The Nuggets and Mavericks faced off in a high scoring game Monday night that resulted in a 114-104 victory for the Mavericks. </p>
<p>With the game tied at 89 heading into the fourth, the Mavericks went on a 25-15 run to seal the victory. </p>
<p>Luka Doncic led all scorers with 29 points on 11-18 shooting, while Nikola Jokic had 26 points and 16 rebounds for Denver. </p>
<p>The Nuggets fall to 37-25 on the season while the Mavericks improve to 28-36.</p>
<h1 id="Take-care-of-the-basketball-and-you-take-care-of-the-game-–-George-Karl"><a href="#Take-care-of-the-basketball-and-you-take-care-of-the-game-–-George-Karl" class="headerlink" title="Take care of the basketball and you take care of the game – George Karl"></a>Take care of the basketball and you take care of the game – George Karl</h1><p>In order to be a great basketball coach, you have to understand that the game is not just about Xs and Os. It’s about taking care of the basketball. If you take care of the ball, the game will take care of itself.</p>
<p>Legendary coach George Karl has been preaching this philosophy for years. And it’s a philosphy that has led him to over 1,000 career wins.</p>
<p>“Take care of the basketball and you take care of the game,” Karl said. “It sounds simple, but it’s not easy to do. You have to have a lot of discipline and a lot of attention to detail. You have to be able to make quick decisions on the floor and you have to be able to teach your players how to take care of the ball. If you can do all those things, you can be successful as a coach.”</p>
<p>Karl has been able to do all those things throughout his career and he has been one of the most successful coaches in NBA history. He is one of just 10 coaches in league history with 1,000 or more career wins and he has won two Coach of the Year Awards. He also led the Denver Nuggets to six consecutive playoff appearances from 2004-09.</p>
<p>But despite his success as a coach, Karl always emphasizes the importance of taking care of the basketball. And he believes that if more teams would adopt that philosophy, they would be more successful on the court.</p>
<p>“I think it would help if more teams took care of the basketball,” Karl said. “But I also think that teams need good players who can handle and pass the ball well in order to be successful. There are a lot of variables involved in being successful in this game, but I think taking care of the ball is one of the most important ones.”</p>
<h1 id="What’s-Wrong-With-The-Denver-Nuggets"><a href="#What’s-Wrong-With-The-Denver-Nuggets" class="headerlink" title="What’s Wrong With The Denver Nuggets?"></a>What’s Wrong With The Denver Nuggets?</h1><p>The Denver Nuggets just wrapped up their 2017-2018 season, and it was a disappointment to say the least. The Nuggets finished with a 46-36 record, which was good for the eighth seed in the Western Conference. However, they were quickly eliminated by the Minnesota Timberwolves in five games. So, what’s wrong with the Denver Nuggets?</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Nuggets need to improve their defense. They finished the season ranked 17th in defensive rating, which is not good enough. They need to find a way to better protect the rim and get more stops in order to make a deep playoff run.</p>
<p>Another big issue for the Nuggets is their shooting. They finished the season ranked 27th in three-point percentage and 22nd in effective field goal percentage. If they want to be successful moving forward, they need to improve their shooting from long range.</p>
<p> Additionally, the Nuggets need more consistency from their top players. Nikola Jokic had an All-Star season but was largely inconsistent down the stretch. Jamal Murray also had his share of ups and downs throughout the year. The Nuggets need their top players to be more consistent if they want to make a deep playoff run.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Nuggets have some work to do this offseason if they want to compete in the Western Conference next year. They need to improve their defense, shooting and consistency if they want to make a run at the NBA Finals.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-power-rankings-Nuggets-drop-after-loss-to-Mavs"><a href="#NBA-power-rankings-Nuggets-drop-after-loss-to-Mavs" class="headerlink" title="NBA power rankings: Nuggets drop after loss to Mavs"></a>NBA power rankings: Nuggets drop after loss to Mavs</h1><p>The Denver Nuggets have had a rough week, dropping games to the Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks. The Nuggets are now in sixth place in the Western Conference with a record of 39-28.</p>
<p>The Mavericks were able to come away with the win on Tuesday night behind 28 points from Luka Doncic. Nikola Jokic led the way for the Nuggets with 27 points and 14 rebounds, but it wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>In the loss to Houston, the Nuggets shot just 35 percent from the field and only 26 percent from three-point range. Gary Harris was held scoreless for just the second time this season, going 0 for 3 from the field.</p>
<p>Denver will look to get back on track as they take on the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night.</p>
