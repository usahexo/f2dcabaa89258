In this article, we will walk you through the steps necessary to create an online blackjack game that features surrendering.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-the-Game"><a href="#Creating-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Creating the Game"></a>Creating the Game</h2><ol>
<li><p>The first step is to create a new file and name it “surrender.js.” This file will contain all of the code necessary for our game.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, we need to declare some variables. The first variable will be an array of objects that represent each player’s hand. The second variable will be an array of objects that represent the dealer’s hand. The third variable will be an integer that represents the number of decks in use.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>var players = []; var dealers = []; var Deck = 52; //number of cards in a deck</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The next step is to create a function that will deal cards to both the players and dealers hands. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a dealerIndex . It will also return an object that contains information about the card dealt. This function should look like this:</li>
</ol>
<p>function deal(playerIndex, dealerIndex) { //dealer’s cards for (var i = 0; i &lt; Deck; i++) { if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 11) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “clubs” }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 1) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “spades” }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 2) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “hearts” }); } else if (players[playerIndex].getCard(i) == 3) { dealers[dealerIndex].push({ rank: i, suit: “diamonds” }); } } //returns an object with info about the card dealt return { rank : dealers[dealerIndex][0], suit : dealers[dealerIndex][1] }; }</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The next step is to create a function that will determine whether or not a player can surrender their hand. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a dealer Index . It should return true if the player wants to surrender and false if they do not want to surrender. This function should look like this:</li>
</ol>
<p>function canSurrender(playerindex, dealerindex) { //check each card for (var i = 0; i &lt; players[playerindex].cards().length; ++i) { //if card is 10 or ace if (players[playerindex].cards()[i] &gt;= 10 &amp;&amp; players[playerindex].cards() [i] &lt;= Ace) return true; } //if all cards are low value // conclude player cannot surrender if (!players[playerindex].hasMoreCards()) return false; }</p>
<p> xtrue  } </p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Next, we need to create a function that will allow players to place bets on the game. This function will accept two parameters: a playerIndex and a betAmount . It should update the players balance accordingly and also increase the betAmount by the betAmount amount when called again later in the game. This function should look like this: </li>
</ol>
<p>function placeBet(playerindex, betAmount) { //update player’s balance players[playerindex].balance += betAmount; //increment betAmount by amount of betAmount so subsequent calls will increase amount by same value betAmount += betAmount; };</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Finally, we need to create our main() function which will control the flow of our game. This function should accept two parameters: an Array of Players and an Array of Dealers . It should first initialize all variables then call our other functions as needed. The main() function should look like this: </li>
</ol>
<p>function main(players, dealers) { //initialize variables Deck = 52; players = []; dealers = []; for (var i = 0; i &lt; Deck; ++i) { players push({ rank : “Ace”, suit : “spades”}); } for (var j=0 ;j&lt;Deck ;++j){ decks push({ rank : j % 13 + 1, suit : “clubs”}); } for (var k=0 ;k&lt;Deck ;++k){ decks push({ rank : k % 13 + 1, suit : “diamonds”}); }; init(); console .log(“Players:\t”, players); console .log(“Dealers:\t”, dealers); while (!isGameOver()) { processInput(); deal(); updateDisplay(); place</p>

Considering that then, I’ve been asked by many people how to develop the same game but with a unique house edge. So in this post, I’ll demonstrate how you can develop your own on the web crypto casino VIP blackjack game with surrender in minutes making use of my code as a starting point.</p>
<h1 id="Before-We-Start"><a href="#Before-We-Start" class="headerlink" title="Before We Start"></a>Before We Start</h1><p>If you want to follow along and create your own game, you will first need to have some basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, you will also require a local development environment set-up which includes Node.js and NPM. If you are not familiar with these technologies, don’t worry - there are plenty of online tutorials which can walk you through the process.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-the-Game-Board"><a href="#Creating-the-Game-Board" class="headerlink" title="Creating the Game Board"></a>Creating the Game Board</h1><p>The first thing we need to do is create the HTML template for our game board. This will include the layout of our game grid as well as the labels for each column and row. Open up your favorite text editor and create a new file called “game-board.html”. Next, insert the following code into the file:</p>
<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <title>Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack</title> </head> <body> <div class="game-board"> <h1>Crypto Casino VIP Blackjack</h1> <table class="game-board-table"> <tr><th colspan="2">Game Board</th></tr> <tr><th rowspan="2">Column 1</th><th rowspan="2">Column 2</th><th rowspan="2">Column 3</th><th rowspan="2"></th></tr> <tr><td colspan="3">Number 1</td></tr> <tr><td colspan="3">Number 2</td></tr> <tr><td colspan="3">Number 3</td></tr> </table> </div> </body> </html>

<p>Save this file in your project folder. The code above creates a simple HTML table which will be used to display our game board. We have also included some basic styling which will give our table a neater look. You can see a preview of what this looks like below:</p>
<p>Now that we have our game board in place, let’s start coding up the functionality for our game.</p>
<h1 id="Coding-Up-the-Game-Logic"><a href="#Coding-Up-the-Game-Logic" class="headerlink" title="Coding Up the Game Logic"></a>Coding Up the Game Logic</h1><p>We will be using JavaScript to code up the game logic for our blackjack game. Open up a new file called “game.js” and insert the following code into it:</p>
<p>var GAME_OPTIONS = { // Set the maximum number of players allowed in the game numPlayers: 5, // Set up arrays to store player data playerData: [], dealerData: [], // Create an array to store player’s current hand data currentHandData: [], }; function getCoin() { return Math.floor(Math.random()<em>1000000000).toString(10); } function dealCard(playerId) { // Deal card to player id var dealerIndex = Math.floor((playerId - 1) / 2); var dealerCard = cards[dealerIndex]; return dealerCard; } function hit() { // Called when user wants to hit currentHandData[playerId][0]++; if (currentHandData[playerId][0] &gt; 21) { // Player has gone bust currentHandData[playerId] = []; } } function stand() { // Called when user wants to stand currentHandData[playerId] = []; } functiondoubleDown() { /</em> Make sure player is allowed to double down <em>/ if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 0) { alert(“You cannot double down.”); return; } /</em> Update hand data */ currentHandData[playerId][1] <em>= 2; /</em> Draw another card <em>/ dealCard(playerId); } function split() { /</em> Make sure player is allowed to split <em>/ if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 11 || currentHandData[playerId][1] === 12) { alert(“You cannot split.”); return; } /</em> Update hand data <em>/ currentHandData[playerId][1] = 0; /</em> Draw another card */ dealCard(playerId); } function Surrender() { if (currentHandData[playerId][1] === 15) { alert(“You cannot Surrender.”); return; } currentHandData[playerID][1]=0; } window.onload = init;</p>

Thanks to its simple rules, online blackjack is a great game for beginners and experienced players alike. In this article we will show you how to setup an online blackjack game with surrender in less than five minutes.</p>
<h2 id="Setting-Up-the-Game"><a href="#Setting-Up-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up the Game"></a>Setting Up the Game</h2><p>The first step is to create a new table. To do this, click on the “Tables” tab and then select “Create Table”.</p>
<p>Enter a name for your table and set the minimum and maximum bet sizes. For this example we will set the minimum bet size to $1 and the maximum bet size to $100. Click on “Create Table” to create the table.</p>
<p>Next, we need to add some players to the table. To do this, click on the “Players” tab and then select “Add Player”.</p>
<p>Enter a name for your player and then click on “Add Player”. Repeat this process until you have added all of the players you want to your table.</p>
<h2 id="Playing-the-Game"><a href="#Playing-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Playing the Game"></a>Playing the Game</h2><p>Now that our game is set up, it’s time to play! The basic rules of online blackjack are as follows: - The player is dealt two cards face up - The player can either stand (do nothing) or hit (take another card) - The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over - If the player goes over 21, they lose - If the player stands, their total is compared against that of the dealer - If the player beats the dealer, they win - If the player loses, they lose their bet amount </p>
<p>To play blackjack, click on one of your players and then click on either “Hit” or “Stand”. When you are done playing your turn, press “Pass” so that it will be the next player’s turn.</p>

<p>One great example of an online casino game is blackjack. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and it’s easy to see why. The game is simple to learn but can be quite challenging, which keeps players engaged. And thanks to online casinos, you can now play blackjack against other real players from around the world.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in playing blackjack online, there are a few things you need to know first. In this article, we’ll discuss how to create an online blackjack game that features surrendering as an option. We’ll also cover what you need to do to get your game up and running. So let’s get started!</p>
<h1 id="Setting-Up-the-Game-1"><a href="#Setting-Up-the-Game-1" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up the Game"></a>Setting Up the Game</h1><p>To create a blackjack game that features surrendering, you first need to set up the game properly. This includes creating the necessary files and folders, as well as setting up the correct file permissions. Here are the steps you need to take:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new folder on your web server and name it “blackjack-surrender”. This is where your game files will reside.</li>
<li>Inside the “blackjack-surrender” folder, create another folder named “images”. This is where your game images will reside.</li>
<li>Inside the “blackjack-surrender” folder, create a file named “config.php” and save it in plain text format. This file will contain your game configuration settings. </li>
<li>Copy all of the files from the supplied “src” folder into your “blackjack-surrender” folder. </li>
<li>Set proper file permissions for all files in your “blackjack-surrender” folder using CHMOD notation .755 or 755 for read/write/execute for owner, group, and world; 664 or 664 for read/write for owner and group; 444 or 444 for read only for owner and group).<br>The following is an example line of CHMOD notation: chmod 755 images/card_back_left_spades_onlonely1 .jpg<br>This will give everyone Read/Write access to the image file located at images/card_back_left_spades_onlonely1 .jpg </li>
<li>If you are using a MySQL database to store player data, create a new database table named “blackjack_surrender” and add the following columns: id – INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT; player_name – VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL; bet – DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT ‘0′ NULL; chips – DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT ‘0′ NULL;created – TIMESTAMP NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;  </li>
<li>If you are not using a MySQL database to store player data, skip this step.<br>8 ) Edit the file config.php with your own settings. Be sure to include all required settings (see below). </li>
<li>Upload all of your files to your web server using FTP software (e.g., FileZilla).<br>10 ) Test your game by opening it in a web browser on your local computer (localhost). Make sure everything works as expected before going live on a public server! </li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have our game set up properly, let’s take a look at some of the important configurable options that are available to us in config.php .</p>
<h1 id="Game-Configuration-Options"><a href="#Game-Configuration-Options" class="headerlink" title="Game Configuration Options"></a>Game Configuration Options</h1><p>The following is a list of all configurable options that are available in config.php :</p>
<p>dbhost – The hostname or IP address of your MySQL database server dbuser – The username that has access to your MySQL database dbpass – The password for the dbuser above dbname – The name of your MySQL database tableprefix – A prefix that will be appended to all table names in your MySQL database (optional) enabledSurrendering – Whether or not surrendering is enabled (true = enabled, false = disabled) allowedSurrenderPercentage - The allowed surrender percentage (must be between 0% and 100%) hitOrStandAfterSplitting - Whether or not players are allowed to hit after splitting (true = allowed, false = not allowed) splitLimit - The maximum number of splits that can be made (defaults to 2) doubleDownLimit - The maximum number of doubles that can be made (defaults to 1</p>
